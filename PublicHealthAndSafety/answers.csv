The old-age pension provides for a standard of living which is basic, at best. Without an additional cushion of a private income source, many older people struggle.Socially, they may well have had more contacts. An inevitable reality about getting older is that one starts to both lose the ability to maintain a social life (perhaps being unable to drive) but also the social group becomes diminished because of ill health or death of the other group members.Additionally, older people are often seen as 'invisible' members of society. There have been studies which have shown that older people are often 'overlooked' in shops, restaurants etc. That is not a particularly good thing to become aware of, many individuals feel that it shows that they are not valued.Sadly, it remains a fact that older people are discriminated against in the health service (in the UK) this may take the form of not receiving the same treatment or enduring longer waiting lists.The summary then is that life often was better than it is now.  Embed QuoteVia  Adira Rotstein."

You're forced, to some degree, to keep up with technology because life requirements demand it.Then one day, you get off that treadmill - your children leave to start their own families and run on their own treadmills, and you retire from working. Once you are off the treadmill, technology changes move too quickly to keep up with. And since you are no longer required to - and an employer is no longer handing you new technology to deal with, you slow down. You're not sending yourself to classes to learn how to do social media, or neural networking or whatever the newest thing will be. And, for most people, income drops, so new technology purchases do, too.One day, you just think, my old my cellphone is fine, my iPod is fine. I don't really need to learn the new brainwave-controlled technology and anyway, it's expensive. The folks on the treadmill zip by and you are your grandparent, with one old cabinet TV, no cable, an old dial-up phone and a brand new stereo system that your kids gave you...and that you have no idea how to use.As the lack of constant new data that has to be assimilated catches up with you, you start reminiscing about how simpler it was when you were younger. People had three channels on TV, they went outside to talk to neighbors, the weather wasn't so strange. Food was tastier (because of course you were younger and could eat anything and now you're diabetic and have a heart condition and have to watch everything you eat.) Travel wasn't as scary, because you watch the news which uses the word ""terrorist"" every third sentence and there was no TSA.People were nicer then, of course, because everything ""back then"" was better. The fact that the sky over London is clearer now than in the 1870s when the coal smoke made it unbreathable notwithstanding, the air was cleaner in your youth, when cold and hot and exhaust didn't bother you half as much.Your memories of things start to focus on the good, and lose the bad. Your life gets smaller. You sell your house and move into a room in a senior community. Of course it was better when you were young and your family was starting out. Now TV talks about Twitter and Facebook and you don't really understand or like computers....everyone online is stealing your identity, the news says. Spam email terrifies you. (How do they know my name?!? Or that I went to school in Townville?!?) You knew what people were talking about back then. Music sounds weird, and people don't talk sense any more.The news terrifies you. War and danger on all fronts - ALL THE TIME. There is no respite. Children killed by drunk drivers, people dying of cancer, there's never any good news that doesn't have to do with pets being rescued. The world is bigger and has more countries than it did when the USSR was our only real enemy. How can a person really know if the girl who cleans their room is trustworthy? She wears a headscarf and the news tells you all the time that that means she can't really be trusted.My grandmother passed away this last winter at 95. We talked about things like this. In her final years, her only media was TV and because the news made her so upset, she mostly only watched TV Judge shows. She traveled a lot in her life, so she knew that the world was not terrifying. She stopped learning new things when it just became too much for her.But I see other older folks, being terrified every day by the news, sure that the world is waiting to get them, steal their money, torch their churches, etc. I've had personal direct experience with the narrowing of an already pretty narrow and grudging worldview and it's not hard to see how older folks can't see the positive in the changes around them. Change is hard and it's scary. The world right now is not predictable and most importantly...it's not the same as something they already know.  Embed Quote"

But I heard about Quora, investigated, and found that it provides a more interesting connection to a worldwide community.  I'll update this in about 10 years & let you know if the plan's working for me.  :)  Embed Quote"

When older people remember the past glowingly, most fundamentally, they are remembering a time that was **their** time; they were in their prime and in the driver seat of life. When one gets older, they are less in control of the world around them, less of a shaping influence, and as a result, typically feel a bit alienated by the present. It is foreign to them.I hearken back to a great quote by legendary San Francisco Chronicle writer Herb Caen talking about how San Francisco had lost its charms, how Market Street was always under construction, and how things had gotten so expensive that the locals were getting squeezed out.Nodding as I read this, it was all a set up by Caen, who quipped, ""Would it surprise you to know that I wrote this in 1956.""More of the story: everything old is new again, and the past is always better than the present, even when the present is just like the past.  Embed Quote"

For one thing, real estate speculation hadn't raised the price of home ownership, and most middle class people, or even lower middle class people, could buy a house. Housing cost about a quarter of people's incomes. Now, thanks to the real estate market, aging parents are seeing it's impossible for their children to live as comfortably.But perhaps the most tragic development in modern times is the disintegration of the family. As people became more mobile, families no longer lived together, or even close. The extended family disappeared as a cultural norm and was replaced by the nuclear family, which in turn has become outflanked by the single-parent family. Older people once aged surrounded by their  younger family members, and were part of the social fabric, serving a purpose as mentors to their grandchildren, baby-sitters, and respected voices of experience. All too often now, they're shunted off to senior housing, where they are surrounded only by peers, and have no purpose.Society was once made  up of an amalgamation of age groups, but it is now far more segregated. If you go to almost any American venue, there is a general age breakdown-- places where elderly people go, places where 20-somethings go. There are senior hours at pools, kid hours at pools. Very few things are age-indiscriminate, like sporting events (and curiously, Burning Man).Experience used to matter in the workplace, but now if you're over 50 and unemployed, good luck getting a job. The value of hindsight has been overpowered by the bottom-line value of paying entry-level salaries. Psychologically, there's a clear indication that people are more troubled. A fifth of all children in this country now take meds for psychiatric difficulties, and we have become the Prozac Nation. Surely, people are more alienated, as real community involvement diminishes. We don't know our neighbors, and most of our interactions with others are mediated by one form of plastic box or another. (I write this of course as a devotee of community through the plastic box).Our food has become poisonous. Agribusiness coats growing things with chemicals to make harvests bigger and prettier. Companies like Monsanto genetically alter food so that we rely on them for crops, instead of nature, which figured it out perfectly well. Livestock is full of hormones, and we ingest these things. In order to produce food cheaply, fast food mega-industries feed cattle with ingredients that are raising  the methane production alarmingly, and producing products that are awful for us, if eaten often. Most processed food is full of stuff that's just bad for us, but people eat a lot of it, so they don't have to take time away from their plastic boxes to actually cook.Wars were once fought for better reasons, like getting rid of Nazis. Now they're fought for oil. The devastation of huge swaths of the population could be wiped out by some maniac pushing a button or a nuclear power plant going haywire. People used to matter more; but now, the entire world could be brought to a standstill if our plastic boxes stopped working. We're killing the environment, overpopulating, running out of of drinking water, and people are protecting their business interests by paying researchers to prove it isn't true. Our education system has become less effective, and plenty of college students don't know an adjective from an adverb, or even what an adverb is-- or care. The written language is getting increasingly reduced to to things like ""R U OK?""Every generation has had its problems, and the escalation of difficulty has only increased over time. Very few things have actually improved. Things are faster, we live longer (potentially), and we have a black president. But we have lost patience in the process (pissed off when it takes 30 seconds to download information we used to go to library to get), we live longer but less healthfully, and there's still plenty of racism in our culture. Each older generation has regarded ""improvements"" sceptically, and for good reason.  Embed Quote"

Individual organisms don't contain very  many allele copies, no matter how long they live.So, what have you done lately for your allele frequencies?Are you developing to sexual maturity?Are you fertilizing eggs / getting your eggs fertilized?Are you manufacturing embryos?Are you helping your offspring do the above?If you are doing these things, then your life is keeping your alleles competitive in the gene pool, and natural selection is obviously going to favor genes that let you keep doing those things for as long as possible.But a lot of external factors make you less effective at copying your genes, like aging, disease, and predators. Some alleles make organisms resistant to these factors. But other alleles contribute more to fitness by optimizing the organism's phenotype in the life stage when it really counts.Here are some examples of when lifespan gets traded for other fitness-increasing traits:Some organisms are weak and vulnerable to predators, so they die often.  If the most efficient way for an allele to increase its frequency is to  make the organism reproduce earlier and faster, then the short lifespan  phenotype is a local optimum in the fitness landscape. For organisms  that have good defenses against predators, the  expected payoff is higher for anti-aging genes.Instead of pacing yourself to get through a long life, sometimes  it's better to go all in and just fertilize as many eggs as you can in  one mating season. Think exploding testicles or getting devoured after  sex.Organisms are programmed to give up their life for the kinds of  things that increase the expected reproductive success of a large colony  of their close relatives, like kamikaze attacks on invaders.  Embed Quote"

It is also even more fundamental than evolution, it is the physics evolution relies on. Every process produces waste. There is no way to make an action with perfect efficiency. The wasted produced is spatially linked to the process that produced it. Without a process to maintain itself a process will be subject to fluctuation to its environment. Homeostatis, that we find in living organisms is precisely such a process that makes an organism able to continue in a fluctuation environment. The accumulation of waste is not necessarily an issue but over time its consequences might be threatening for the process that created it.See also Second Law of Thermodynamics  Embed Quote"

Not for everyone, a few people stay sharp until the end of their life, but for most: to age is to diminish. The difference between preserved faculty and diminished faculty was generally thought of as a product of the genetic lottery.Biologically speaking ageing is associated with progressive losses in function across multiple systems including sensation, cognition, memory, motor control, and affect. We weaken physically as bones calcify and muscles atrophy, and our senses become less acute with wear and tear. It has also been assumed that neurological decline in ageing was unavoidable because it was a direct consequence of brain machinery wearing out. This view has changed in the light of recent research in neuroscience, experimental psychology, and other related fields. There are four factors that affect this ""wearing out"" process and they are able to be manipulated. They are: reduced schedules of brain activity; noisy processing; weakened neuromodulatory control; and negative learning. These factors interact to create a self-reinforcing downward spiral of degraded brain function. Brain plasticity processes with negative consequences begin to dominate brain functioning, and this causes a loss of faculty. In other words, your ability to learn and think novel thoughts is greatly reduced by thinking in circles—by thinking the same thoughts every day: by habit and by not challenging yourself. If you consider your brain to be like other muscles, then like other muscles when you don't exercise, you lose mass and power. The solution for staying sharp into your dotage is exercise. Give your brain regular workouts.Experiments with this concept have shown that substantial improvement is possible even after brain function has started to degrade. Driving brain plasticity toward recovery and sustained power requires engaging in demanding sensory, cognitive, and motor activities on an intensive basis. This form of mental exercise measurably increases the fidelity, reliability, and power of cortical representations. You can actually choose not to lose your wits as you age. It just requires some thought.  Embed QuoteVia  Shubham Rander."

Either the animal has no long-lived non-dividing cells (such as clams), or it is cold-blooded and typically grows throughout life (such as various fish, amphibians and reptiles), or it lives in a very warm constant-temperature environment (such as naked mole rats), or it's reeeeally big so its specific metabolic rate is lower (such as whales), or it doesn't actually live longer than us, only longer for its size (such as various birds). All these differences result in either the ""aging problem"" being not so severe for those species as for humans, such that the animal can live longer than us without having more sophisticated anti-aging tricks, or else the problem being ostensibly more severe but not in ways that necessarily matter for longevity. On top of that, a modestly more sophisticated anti-aging setup would almost certainly not point the way to a human therapy, because the benefits conferred by copying some genetic difference or other would be outweighed by the problems caused by trying to dovetail it with the highly optimised network of everything else that humans have.The most promising exception to the above is the uncanny rarity of cancer in a variety of long-lived lower vertebrates, and also in naked mole rats. The incidence of cancer in such species appears to be so dramatically lower than in mammals (even humans) that there does seem to be a real chance of finding a trick that could be applied to humans without being outweighed by the dovetailing problem. Some of the best work on this is being done by the Gorbunova lab in Rochester.Don't get too excited about the frozen frogs - they only go a little below 0oC. They do it by replacing a lot of their water with sugar. Certain lower species can do this better and go down to as low as -30 as I recall, but for useful cryopreservation in anticipation of revival when better medicine exists we need much lower temperatures than that: plenty of chemistry, in particular decay of tissue, still happens at -30.  Embed Quote"

When we're children, the larynx grows rapidly, along with vocal folds and other support structures. Below is an illustration of the approximate difference between membranous length (Lm), cartilagenous length (Lc), and total vocal fold length (Lm + Lc):The first twenty or so years after birth typically show a growth rate of around 0.7mm/year for males and 0.4mm/year for females. Growth of vocal folds causes the Fundamental frequency (Fo) to drop off as demonstrated by the equation:Though children have smaller total vocal fold lengths, their greater Fo ability can cause a much more intense sound (example: a screaming baby). During adolescence, male Testosterone (steroid hormone) actually increases the rate of growth for the larynx (more quickly than in females) which in turn increases the overall thickness and size of vocal folds. The longer folds result in a lower Fo in males and increases in thickness cause a voice tone change. Physiologically, things like facial development, lowering of the larynx, and increases in chest wall/lung circumference all play factors in voice change. The voice is matured approximately at age twenty. The graph below illustrates Fo as a function of age:In the middle aged, potential ossification/hardening of cartilage in the larynx can have an effect on the voice. In some cases, this more rigid support can improve potential singing quality (supports tension in vocal cords). Undesired changes can also occur: edema, atrophy, dystrophy.

Please bear with me.Why do so many people think it's acceptable to send their parents to nursing homes?Simply, because it is acceptable, why shouldn't it be?I don't know whether you have any awareness of the health care needs of some older people? I do. Both personally and professionally.When I was 5, my grandfather had a stroke. He was unable to stand or walk or speak or feed himself for the remaining 9 years until he died. He wasn't in a Nursing Home - I wish he had have been. My dad used to go 3 or 4 times a week to put my grandfather to bed. My dad was a military man, he was disciplined, I didn't see him for half of my childhood. My dad had a heart attack when he was 39, that may have been because he was in a very high pressured job, it may have been because he was never able to rest.Is that 'acceptable' I wonder, I'm not sure. My childhood, my brother's childhood was affected firstly by my grandfather's illness, then by my dad's absence, and then by the illness he suffered.I think it would have been far more 'acceptable' if my grandfather had been looked after in a Nursing Home, instead of the sheer bloody grind that we endured- we could have had quality time with my grandfather, sharing memories and laughing instead of worrying.Now the professional opinion. Again, I'm not sure that the questioner actually knows how 'needy' some elderly people are? Let me tell you about 'Joe' (obviously not his real name)Joe was a 82 year old male. He was an ex-sailor. He had served in WWII, he was decorated for bravery, he worked hard all of his life, he was a good man. When he was in his 60's he suffered a double amputation (years of smoking) he had high blood pressure, he had emphysema, he had diabetes. He was incontinent of urine (he had a stroke) His physical needs were huge, it required a team of carers to look after him. He deserved the best care, he received the best care. The best care was not that provided by his family, despite the fact that they loved him dearly - his needs were too great. The BEST care was that provided by the beautiful Nursing Home where he lived. The staff loved him, they cared for him, they fed him, they made sure that he was clean and shaved, they told him jokes. They sometimes 'sneaked' beer to him ( he liked a beer!) when he died, they wept tears of sorrow in my department, they stood with his family and cried.Is that unacceptable?The second question - 'It seems cruel to send your parents to a nursing home'I would ask why? Why is it cruel? Some people need 24 hour care. They are demanding, their physical needs are massive (think about Joe), I wonder what is more cruel, a family functioning on no sleep, with no training, who are unable to devote any time to caring because they need to earn a living. I don't think so.'I assume that most elderly would rather be taken care of by their children?'I'm on the fence about this one, (that is an English term for undecided), some of them would, some of them wouldn't. Most of them are pragmatic enough to realise that it isn't an option that is feasible.  And finally, I would say that there is no reason to feel guilty, being a child of a parent in need means that you want the best for them. The likelihood is that the best is the care that a Nursing Home can provide - with love and support and visits from children who are not bent double with exhaustion.  Embed Quote"

which is why we staff have to hold a weekly meeting called ""Utilization Review"" wherein we make sure we have all the documentation necessary to force an insurance company to pay for the stay. **  And Medicaid, (Federal/State insurance for the poor and elderly usually administrated by a third party such as, in our case, ""Bridgeway"")  usually doesn't quite cover costs, but is our bed-and-butter.  In our Facility, we figure every 8 Bridgeway patients and we break even;  see, Bridgeway doesn't pay by the cost, but by the month.  One patient may be fairly independent, care-wise, and another a two-person full-assist, but the money's the same.  So, putting Mom or Dad into a nursing home is rarely about getting rid of them so we can have a normal life, not unless you've got far more disposable income than you know what to do with-  skilled nursing is too expensive.  It might be about selfish comfort, but, at the same time, there's also a healthy dose of, deserved,  fear:  Do YOU know what to do when Mom chokes a bit on her coffee every single day?  When Dad's butt starts breaking down because he won't get out of that damned recliner?  When they can't get up by themselves without falling but they don't sleep well at night?  When you still can't use the dining room after 3 months because it looks like, well, a room in a nursing home?Here's another little statistic which might help put things in perspective:  Research shows that after 3 years of being a hands-on caregiver in the home, the caregiver is no longer able to ask for assistance- his or her self-image is so intertwined with the guilt of being the caregiver they are unable to admit they can't do it anymore.  This is when people die-  and it's usually the caregiver.________________________________________________________________**We are currently in our twice yearly fight with Bridgeway over our dementia care Residents.  See, folks who have dementia and meet a specific care need- in our case, ""wandering""- are eligible for $20/mo extra to pay for the special care unit's special staffing and routines.  If someone wanders all over the facility looking for their room or their mother or their car or a way out, they get placed on the special care unit.  It's quiet, with special staffing who have special training.  Very, very soon, Residents calm down, feel safer (it isn't medication-  the SCU policy is to d/c meds as soon as possible) and so quit wandering.  And, twice yearly, Bridegway does an audit and discovers all these people they're paying extra for aren't wandering so they aren't going to pay for them to stay in the SCU anymore.  So we either have to come up with a way to creatively document that people are wandering when they're not, or we have to keep moving people back into the main units and stress the hell out of them, wait for them to have a crisis and try to elope, in order to get them back on the SCU where they belong.  That's just stupid.  Embed Quote"

And yet, people have such a wide range of needs and capabilities that having a categorical bias against nursing homes is simply narrow minded.  For many people, it is the best way to take care of their parents. And that is certainly acceptable, and actually preferable.  I recall not too long ago ""putting my foot in my mouth"" when I mentioned to someone how sad it was to see elders inventoried in these places, only to find out that he just put his mother in such a facility after being unable to take care of her as she advanced into very complicated medical issues.  Oops.  I made a judgmental assumption.  I was wrong.  Situations are more complex for some people.That said -- once in the nursing home, you do not have to treat them like inventory.  You can make it your business to visit them often.  You can even visit other people too.  In fact, I used to sing in a choir and we'd rehearse at a nursing home (someone had a connection with the management). Some of the residents really enjoyed the weekly activity (and we got to use the space!).  Better to be creative than judgmental.  Embed Quote"

But independant living, senior living, assisted living and nursing care in and of itself is not harsh and can allow you to ensure your loved one receives the best care, without guilt.  Embed Quote"

When my wife and I had our son we asked my mother and father to move in with us. The thinking at the time was to combine households. The grandparents would help raise my son and they could retire (they are in the early 60s,so retirement was looming) and enjoy their later years. We'd be there to take care of them as they got older.They already have a number of health issues, but are not in need of any sort of daily care per say. Unfortunately, a fair amount of conflict arose. I would liken the issues to the problems parents face when college or adult age children move back in with them. Everyone's intentions were good, however we now had a household divided with two kings and two queens. This is harder to handle than it might sound. It wasn't constant fighting, and there were good parts to it, but it wasn't the storybook ending we'd hoped for. In the end my parents moved back into their home and it is still up in the air how things will proceed when they reach more advanced ages.That being said here are some other jumbled up thoughts.In the US, many elderly people do not want to give up living in their own homes. They are reluctant to lose the Independence of their retirement years whether it is by moving into a retirement home or by moving in with their children. The result is that many stay in their homes until very late into their lives. Often in the case of couples it is up until one of them passes away. At this point the remaining partner may be quite elderly and the care required may be overwhelming for a working family. If the elderly had been willing to move in when they were ""younger"" the transition may have been easier and more feasible.Related cultural observations. in the US, people are taught to be independent. Kids generally move out at 18 and if all goes according to plan, they don't move back in. This has the positive effect of teaching the children to be self reliant but it may also reduce their sense of obligation to their family. Multiple generation child rearing in the US is mostly a thing of the past. Historically families may have insisted the elderly stay with them, but up until it became unreasonable, the elderly contributed to the family.  Embed Quote"

Because not everyone has the time, attention, and care to devote to their parents. Although, there are some alternatives to consider before choosing a nursing home. Mobility aids can make it easier to move around, protect us from falling, and help us live more independently. But if your parents need more support - a nursing home may be necessary.So instead of questioning the motive of the situation (thinking it's """"OK"""" to send parents to a nursing home), it's important to also question the context of the situation (whether they have the resources and attention to care for the parents).

Often a very physically or mentally debilitated old person has worse health and even mental health when looked after family members who are unable to cope.People develop pressure sores, infections, are sometimes neglected or have inadequate personal hygiene because the poor family members cannot physically look after the old person. Often they keep having to come to hospital because of these reasons and the hospital is certainly not a great way to spend the rest of your years.My extended family is from Sri Lanka and they have done a remarkable job of looking after the old people in our family, something they had no choice about. Fortunately none of them suffered from these complications. They however have much more support from the extended family because society is not structured in strict nuclear family units. I still wish though that there were many more options and social services and help for them.It's very romantic thinking from a privileged western perspective that taking care of an ill, disabled or demented old person is noble and should be compulsory. It's not romantic and it's often impossible. It involves faeces and urine and sputum and bedsores and pus and infections and pneumonia and spending hours and days and weeks in the hospital. And not getting enough help and feeling horribly guilty that you could not do more.Additionally, let's not forget the dark side of non-Western cultures and being forced to take care of elderly family members. There are people whose spouses desert them because they don't want to have to look after their in-laws, leaving them destitute. There are people who have to quit work to look after their family members full time and cannot feed their families. There are large families you fight and argue about the care of the old person and criticise the person who is actually looking after the old person without contributing anything.  Embed Quote"

At some point, a threshold is crossed where its simply not safe or dignified for someone to be living at home, even with a robust care package in place. I can only speak from the UK experience and having been a dementia physician and now as an entrepreneur trying to prolong independence at home.(HomeTouch: Home)A more elegant question might have been - what can be done to prolong the time before someone needs institutional care (bearing in mind that 95% + of older people want to remain in their own homes when asked before they become too frail) Imagine if you are cognitively and visually impaired, at risk of falls, and doubly incontinent. It would be practically impossible for someone that frail to remain at home for long. Some live-in care providers do this at home, but the costs of 24 hr 1:1 care are more than a home.Having said all this, one of the revealing (and unsettling) pieces of information I learnt was  the way the largest care home chains think of the ""marketing funnel"" for new care home residents. There is, apparently, the ""crisis"" route and the ""considered"" route. The crisis route is when Mum ends up in the ER after a fall; everything has broken down, its Christmas Eve and she can't go home. She needs to be placed immediately. Its a fait accompli.  The ""considered"" route is where the care homes knowingly play on families emotions to convert a sale. Nice surroundings, ensuite bathroom, gentle counselling, accessible visiting etc. Typically the sales cycle can last months as the family deliberate and agonise over the decision; there's sibling conflict, visits to other homes. Whatever you think of this, it is how some care homes chains think. Where I don't agree with the other posters is that this outcome is at least partially driven by family guilt, whatever the medical/care needs of the parent.  Embed Quote"

Additionally, being cared for at home is also generally less expensive than staying in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. Your loved ones would also appreciate the fact that a homecare setup allows them to closely monitor your health and well-being as you grow older, which they probably won’t be able to do if you were in a nursing home and daily visits are too much of a hassle. Another good reason to go for elderly homecare as opposed to entering a nursing home is that it’s a more flexible solution. You can tailor-fit the kind of services you get to your specific needs and requirements. For example, if you can still pretty much do things on your own as long as they’re done while you’re seated, your caregiver could simply assist you with such tasks as getting in and out of bed or taking items from cupboards and shelves. In a nursing home setup, patients are generally cared for in the same way and differ only when there are special medications or treatments needed, thus taking away much of the flexibility of being cared for at home.  Embed Quote"

An important quality for adult children in caregiving is to admit when they can't do it alone. It is one thing to appreciate their own responsibility towards their parents, and it is a good thing. But they also need to appreciate that it is the senior's livelihood and happiness which matters more than meeting the responsibility themselves.Caregiving, without a doubt, has more to it than what we see. It has complicated challenges. That said, sending the seniors to care homes should not be an easy way out, but a sensible decision in the best interest of the seniors in concern.  Embed Quote"

Gluten is obviously a no-no for anyone with Celiac's disease but it's quite possibly that gluten causes low-level inflammation in many people that could be pro-aging.Stress. Another obvious one right?Trans fats/fried foods. Also hopefully quite obvious.So much more to say here but I think this is a good list to start with of things to avoid or minimize.  Embed Quote

He would have been somewhere between 70-80.And he was telling me how conflict in the Desert was different and had different challenges to other conflict. And then he was telling me about air conflict. He seemed to know what he was talking about, so I pondered, out loud, how a retired baker from Nottingham would know this stuff. He wasn't offended that I'd asked.He had been, he told me proudly, one of the desert rats (a name apparently given to a unit of the British Army fighting in North Africa during WWII) and his older brother had been a pilot in the RAF.It was a salutary lesson to me. Previously, I had viewed all 'old people' as just that, old. It hadn't really occurred to me that they had 'history' and intelligence and experience.I've since had the enormous privilege of talking to a huge number of older people. All of them with stories to tell, some of them more mundane, all of them interesting experiences.I've met one of the men who developed ibuprofen, the man credited with developing the MRI scanner for use on patients, one of the only men who managed to escape from the Japanese on more than one occasion during the second world war.What every single one of these people, all of them amazing, had in common, was experience and time.So, in my opinion, one of the greatest intellectual advantages of aging is experience.And I am very lucky to have shared it.  Embed QuoteVia  Sheri Fresonke Harper."

The increased numbers, improves the probability that some of those encounters were rich and that one correspondingly had the opportunity to observe patterns, and thereby gain knowledge and wisdom.

Hemingway, The Old Man and the Sea. There are a lot of themes in Hemingway's novel that would be relevant. The main character, Santiago, seeks to live a simple, dignified life. He struggles with the village's perception of him as a washed up old man--since he has gone 84 days without a catch. There's some contrast between him and his young apprentice, Manolin. I can't guarantee that this novel will work for your paper, but it's short enough that you can read it, decide for yourself, and choose something different if you can't make it fit. In either case, it's a great read. Another book you might find useful, depending, to some extent, on your teacher's tastes, is Jimmy Carter's The Virtues of Aging, which gives a really nice portrait of living the late part of one's life in a meaningful, useful way.  Embed QuoteVia  Shoks Topsy."

While I am optimistic that stem cell technology will change medicine in the future, it is unclear what kinds of stem cells will be used and how they will be used. There are many different stem cell types and lineages - adult stem cells are already partially differentiated and lack the potential to generate many different mature cell types that embryonic stem cells can. If you are posting this question, I'm going to assume its too late to extract your embryonic stem cells. ;)The techniques to maintain and propagate a cell line are imperfect and imprecise. Even if there a beneficial stem cell based therapeutic is developed in ten years, there is limited infrastructure or understanding on how to ""keep"" stem cells. While it might be pleasant to think that one can just freeze cells and use them many years in the future, in reality many commonly used research stem cell lines are continuously maintained in cell culture and cells frozen for a long time can be considered suspect. From personal experience, it seems like freshly thawed cells grow slower and are more difficult to work with. One the hottest areas of investigation in regenerative medicine is the study of iPSC, induced pluripotent stem cells. Using a series of steps involving reprogramming by Yamanaka factors, mature and fully differentiated cells have been turned into cells that are similar to embryonic stem cells. These cells have been shown to exhibit the ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, neurons, and a variety of other cell types. These cells, which can be derived in a patient specific manner, can be generated at will, and probably will limit the value of collecting and banking stem cells.Aside: Different adult stem cell populations reside in different areas of the body - I would imagine any way to harvest them would be invasive. I wouldn't want to be stuck everywhere by tens of needles on the off chance it might be useful in the distant future.  Embed Quote"

For reducing insulin resistance and overcoming my type 2 diabetes, I take chromium, metformine (a powerful anti-aging medication that decreases insulin resistence and which we recommend everyone over 50 consider taking) and gymnema sylvestra. To improve LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, I take policosanol, gugulipid, plant sterols, niacin, oat bran, grapefruit powder, psyllium, lecithine and lipitor. To improve blood vessel health I take arginine, TMG and choline. To decrease blood viscosity I take daily baby aspirin and lumbrokinase. I reduce inflammination by taking EPA/DHA and curcumin. I have dramatically reduced my homocystein level by taking folic acid, B6 and TMG. I have a B12 shot once a week and take a daily B12 sublingual. Several of my intravenous therapies improve my body's detoxification: weekly EDTA and monthly DMPS. I also take n-acetyl-carnitine orally. I take weekly intravenous vitamins and alpha lipoic acid to boost antioxidants. I do a weekly glutathione IV to boost liver health. Perhaps the most important intravenous therapy I do is a weekly phosphatidylcholine IV, wich rejuvenates all of the body's tissues by restoring youthful cell membranes. I also take PtC orally each day and supplement my hormone levels with DHEA and testosterone. I take I-3-C, chrysin, nettle, ginger and herbs to reduce the conversation of testosterone into estrogen. I take a saw palmetto complex for prostate health. For stress management I take l-theonine, beta-sitosterol, phosphatidylserine and green tea in addition to drinking 8 to 10 cups of green tea itself. At bedtime I take GABA and sublingual melatonin. For brain health I take acetyl-l-carnitine, vinprocetine, phosphatidylserine, ginkgo biloba, glycerylphosphatidylcholine, nextrutine and quercertin. For eye health I take lutein and bilberry extract. For skin health I use an antioxidant skin cream on my face, neck and hands every day. For digestive health I take betaine HCl, pepsin, gentian root, peppermint, acidophilus bifodobacter, fructooligosaccharides, fish proteins, l-glutamine and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine.

It is fairly safe to operate under the assumption that you are deficient, though getting a simple blood test is an easy way to know exactly how concerned you need to be. In addition to regular weight bearing exercise - spend a few minutes each day in a deep squat, with feet and knees apart and tailbone towards the floor (search ""garland"" pose for a visual of this position). This will build strength and flexibility into the hip girdle. You are wise to be thinking ahead!  Embed Quote"

Furthermore, smaller organisms like mice tend to have high metabolic rates, and don't live long (two years on average), whereas larger organisms like the blue whale have much slower metabolisms and live for a very long time. What's the relationship here?","First, a terminological point: ""metabolism"" refers to all the molecular and cellular processes that go on in the body, not only breathing. It's only the term ""metabolic rate"" that specifically refers to oxygen consumption.So: Yes, there is a correlation between what's called ""specific metabolic rate"", SMR (which means rate of oxygen consumption per unit body mass) and rate of aging, i.e. an inverse relationship between SMR and maximum potential lifespan. This is no surprise, because breathing is undoubtedly bad for you: it creates free radicals, which damage DNA and other macromolecules, and the rate of accumulation of that damage is a major determinant of the rate of aging. But it's only a modestly tight correlation, because the evolutionary pressure to avoid aging varies from one species to another, and that variation is dependent on many factors. So birds tend to live far longer than rodents of the same size (and thus of similar SMR), because evolution has worked harder on them to bear down on the rate of free radical production per unit oxygen consumption, the resistance of their macromolecules to being damaged by free radicals, etc.  Embed QuoteVia  Michael Sinanian."

An old person may try to talk, but they can't get the conversation going on for long. Usually they go back in their own shell. And in a way it is bad. Good idea would be to start conversations with them, show interest, laugh/smile at their comments, give them time. If you are in a group of people, it would be harder to engage them. One to one talks work better.Loss of interest in survivalThis could be a real problem too. Old people sleep very less, have lots of free time and nothing to do. When they think, mostly they think of impending death. Some might have marriages of their grandchildren to look forward too. But most will feel they have lost their place and relevance in the society/family. It is good to seek the counsel of your elders in such case and make them feel involved.  Embed QuoteAnswered in fifty-one minutes."

How do I become a biomedical gerontologist from here?","Well, there's obviously no one answer - it depends heavily on your personal circumstances, not just your academic background. In 1995 or so when I decided to switch fields from computer science, I was fortunate enough that I was already doing my research in my spare time, which I had been able to arrange to have quite a lot of because my day job in bioinformatics was very undemanding. Thus, I was able to switch painlessly to spending my time in the library (yes, we used physical libraries back then :-)) and going to conferences to get to know the latest information and the leading scientists. It worked - I was able to come up with well-received ideas that were published in good journals. But after that I needed more luck, because there was nowhere to work on biomedical gerontology (hardly any gerontologists back then were even willing to talk about the prospects for intervention in aging). Luckily I came up with some ideas for intervention that were very new and exciting to some people, leading to the creation of a foundation, quite a bit of media attention, and then sizeable donations which have allowed me to fund research. These days it's a bit easier, because intervention is fashionable in the field now - so all you need is the first part, learning biology and impressing people who might employ you. All I would add about doing it in your spare time is that biology is a very ""horizontal"" field as compared to physics, maths etc - you can get away with learning things in a pretty much random order, just so long as you have a good memory, because facts/insights don't build on each other so much.  Embed QuoteVia  Amit Patnaik."

Ask the nurses to ask the patient if they are in pain and need pain drugs. Be alert for signs of pain such as grimacing, restlessness, or not wanting to move or receive care.7.

I had heard there was a theoretical maximum (from the number of telomeres) but this seems contentious; meanwhile wikipedia (fwiw) says 'No fixed theoretical limit to human longevity is apparent today'Is that correct?","If there is a natural ceiling for the human life span, we don’t yet know what it is. Humans who escape all the diseases, accidents and forms of self-destruction that can prematurely claim their lives die as a consequence of organ failure. Cells die off or enter cellular senescence (having lost the ability to divide), and with fewer healthy cells, organs are less able to regulate internal equilibrium or to respond to stress, making you more susceptible to disease. Underperforming organs impose systemic stress, leading to a cascade of organ failure.This prosaic death is what is normally referred to as “dying of old age”. If you are reasonably healthy (and disease doesn't get you) it will occur in your nineties, while those who are very robust will make it to something a little over 100. The oldest verified age a human has attained is 122.But organ failure does not have to be fatal. Surgical replacement of failed organs and broken, diseased or worn-out body parts has become commonplace in modern medicine. If we not unreasonably suppose that surgical techniques and autoimmune-suppression technology will improve, and that organs will become readily available through innovations in manufacture, animal sourcing or bioengineering, replacement surgery could go a long way toward ending premature death. Large-scale surgery will be more feasible if we can master the art of growing new organs from our own stem cells, an increasingly likely possibility.Extending a person’s age into a second or third century presents another problem entirely. Organs are not the only parts that deteriorate with senescence. Skin, bone, flesh, joints, vascular systems, nerves, sensory receptors, hair and teeth—all these, too, lose vitality with age. However, life spans in a range of animals are surprisingly pliable. Mice or rats on near-starvation but nutrient-rich diets can live 30–50 per cent longer than normal. Calorie restriction has also been shown to extend life spans in yeast, worms, flies and monkeys. A near-starvation diet shows promise for humans too, but it reduces fertility and may have other drawbacks. A family of genes known as sirtuins, which appear to regulate survival mechanisms in adverse conditions, are linked to this starvation effect, and manipulating them directly may prompt the same outcome yet remove the need for restriction of calories. Engineering extra copies of the SIR2 gene has increased longevity in organisms as diverse as yeast, roundworms and fruit flies.Even so, after a predetermined number of generations—about 50 in humans—cells become senescent and unable to divide further. Although cell senescence is a complex process, it appears to be tied to the gradual shortening of chromosomal telomeres as cells go through increasing numbers of divisions. Telomeres are long strings of simple repeating bases that, like the aglets on shoelaces, cap chromosomes. Each time chromosomes are duplicated during cell division, these end regions are eroded by a few hundred bases. Hence, telomeres are thought to prevent damage further along the chromosomes, where genes could be affected, by acting as a buffer.A study done with nematodes showed that a worm’s life could be extended 20 per cent by simply lengthening its telomeres. This result has not been replicated in higher animals, although normal human cells in culture have been able to undergo up to 90 divisions in the presence of an enzyme that lengthens telomeres.Accumulated oxidative damage caused by free radicals holds another key to cell senescence. Some believe that ageing is just a manifestation of cumulative oxidative damage. Such damage is linked to a long list of age-related diseases including cancer, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s. Some cancers are thought to result from mutations caused by free-radical damage to DNA.Cellular senescence is not universal in the animal kingdom. It is not observed in some lower organisms, including sponges and crayfish. Many animals, of which the most advanced are salamanders, have another intriguing ability: they can regenerate entire organs and limbs. Humans are believed to have intact, but inactive, versions of the genes that enable these animals to do this. One gene which is active in newts when they are doing their regeneration trick, msx-1, has been identified in humans and mice, and scientists have already found a way to turn it on at will in mice in order to reconstruct damaged muscle cells.This means that—in mice at any rate—not only are the genes present, but the intracellular signalling pathways are intact, too. Only the signals required to start the process are missing. If the same holds true in humans, we could see transplant surgery, and especially surgical repair of organs, replaced by regeneration therapy.  Embed Quote"

In fact, it has been essentially disproved. Plasticity can occur in mature brains. This largely does not occur to any noticeable degree (hence the aforementioned belief), but there are now numerous documented cases of 'neural rewiring', which can involve things like (but is not limited to) the relearning of certain skills in a different brain region following some sort of damage, like a stroke. I vaguely recall an example involving damage to a language region, possibly Wernicke's. The afflicted patient subsequently relearned the lost knowledge, with the processes simply being wired up somewhere else in the brain (probably very nearby).What I think: This decrease in plasticity coincides strongly with our cultural tendency to do a lot of learning in our youth, then to use that knowledge as we age. It strikes me as entirely possible that 'learning' itself is a skill to be learnt, and, like all skills, the less you practice something, the more you find yourself unable to do it. There is a neurological basis for that, actually, but I won't go into it (that would be a part of 'What I know', if I did). So it seems plausible that as we age we unlearn learning, which sounds like some kind of paradox. This may not be the only reason that we lose plasticity, instead I would suggest that it is one factor among many (including, in all likelihood, biological changes).For more information/sources, see The Tell-tale Brain by V.S. Ramachandran, it is very informative and for all audiences (even the old people who can't learn anymore!)  Embed Quote"

Just like watching movies, you can't watch a movie once and understand the whole thing, even if you think you understand it, you can easily forget it if you don't watch it again. And watching it the second would open your eyes to things you thought you understood but did't.  Embed Quote"

Typically these regulations restrict the hours when takeoffs and landings may occur (at DCA, for example, planes are not permitted to take off before 7 am), and in many cases the landing and takeoff paths/trajectories of the planes are regulated so as to minimize the sound to residential communities below them. At LAG, for example, for two weeks in the late summer every year, planes' inbound and outbound routes are restricted because the US Open (tennis) is being played just a few miles away, and the sound of planes landing and taking off is distracting to the players and fans. Less than a mile from the US Tennis Center, however, the New York Mets play their home games (baseball) with planes flying over all the time.  Embed Quote"

There are four main areas you may wish to explore.  1. Either a public regulatory statute in the individual respective state may exist that imposes strict liability (no proof of intent/degree of fault required to be shown) civil fines/penalties, or a statute that criminalizes excessive noise and disturbance.  2. Under the common law of torts, a Nuisance action may be brought by a private land possessor against an alleged tortfeasor, if s/he can prove by a preponderance of evidence that there has been ""substantial (and unreasonable) interference with his/her use and enjoyment of property/land to an unreasonable degree"". The alleged nuisance can arise from intentional, negligent or fault-free (i.e. strict liability) activities, and courts generally tend to balance the competing interests of the parties (though the hypersensitivity of a plaintiff factor is NOT taken account of, nor are any specialized uses). Unlike a trespass action, this can be non-physical (odors/sounds/noise) and hence is purported to be the most plausible and practical cause of action against noise-bearers. 3. Alternatively, again under the common law of torts, if the noise can be deemed an ""ultra hazardous activity"" i.e. an activity that creates the forseeable risk of harm regardless of care exercised by all (a question of law for the court), then the tortfeasor would be held strictly liable for the offense/violation. The test for characterizing an activity as ""ultra-hazardous"" is the following: one that (i) cannot be made safe; (ii) imposes a risk of severe harm, and (iii) is uncommon in the community. Note that safety precautions are irrelevant in such analysis. Further, courts have been reluctant to find noises as ultra hazardous, and have found that there are usually only 3 main activities that fall within this theory, namely (a) blasting/explosives; (b) dangerous chemical/biological materials and (c) nuclear/radioactive materials. 4. Further, one could potentially legally pursue an action under intentional infliction of emotional distress theories. Here, even if the tortfeasor has been reckless in their conduct, they may be found liable under tort law. To prevail on this cause of action, the Defendant must engage in outrageous conduct: ""exceeding all bounds of decency tolerated in a civilized society"". Indicators of outrageousness are as follows: (i) conduct is continuous or repetitive; (ii) D is a common carrier (transit) or innkeeper; (iii) D chose to interact w/ a P who is a member of a fragile class e.g. sm children, the elderly, pregnant woman - these preceding classes are automatically ""outrageous"". Additionally, the defendant must act to exploit P's hypersensitivity (normally a P's hypersensitivy would not make a difference), and P must suffer ""severe emotional distress"" for which there is no affirmative standard, and hence is determined on case by case basis.If there has been any noise-related activity that resulted in a physical manifestation of a stress i.e. heart attack/miscarriage, etc., then you could plausibly pursue a negligent infliction of emotional distress action, assuming there was also a degree of psychiatric harm sustained.  Embed QuoteThis answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice....

What key factors would result in the most significant reduction of road noise?,"Depends. On my KLR, the knobby tires create a fair amount of noise that I can hear at any speed. However, my Harley with stock exhaust and street tires is a very quiet motorcycle. I can do a 400 mile day on the Harley without earplugs with no ringing. 20 miles on KLR and I'm looking for my earplugs. This is all to say there are a lot of variables. Exhaust system, type of tires, helmet type, and windshield have a lot to do with noise. Unless you are running an unmuffled exhaust, the most noise you get can be from wind. Even with a windshield, my KLR has a lot of wind noise. Some of that may be due to the dual-sport helmet I wear when on it — which has recesses for goggles which let in wind noise. Windshields can also direct engine noise up to the rider. Even with gear drive cams, my twin cam Harley is quieter than my KLR with a windshield. It's just a matter of the acoustics. It would seem on most bikes you can mitigate the noise with exhaust mods and tire choice.  Embed QuoteVia  Andrew Denny."

Military aircraft can (and have) been known to fly in all types of weather in all types of areas. An idea: Take a map of your current area and using a compass, draw a circle, whose area would roughly emcompass a five-mile radius of the nearest airport to you. If you live inside of that area, it's very likely that you will experience some noise pollution from aircraft. If that's going to be an issue for you, then I would advise taking a map and locating an area which is more than five miles from any type of major airport or minor airstrip. I would then search for municipalities within that area where you'd care to live and in which you can afford to. Again, many types of aircraft, including emergency helicopters and military aircraft,can and do fly almost anywere they need to. Even if you avoid routine air traffic, you may still have issues with emergency, as well as military, aircraft.  Embed Quote"

The same problem exists with the electric churchbells that most Orthodox Churches use, on a much wider scale.As with all urban planning issues, there is a need for regulations to be upheld. Loudspeakers should be allowed, but they have to obtain a permit from the authorities (usually the local municipality) to control the dB rating of the installation and to make sure that the noise is not excessive, specially in proximity to schools and hospitals. For the same reason night clubs have to carry a similar permit. Local residents can petition the authorities to revoke that license, but they cannot decide this on their own and there must be evidence of abuse. Usually this is done by logging a complaint with the local police department.The above is the ideal situation. In reality, clerics (both Christian and Muslim), very much like night club owners, are influential with the local Mayor and they are able to ""circumvent"" regulations. Sometimes with illegal means. Civil society should condemn such phenomena. The law should be inclusive and tolerant, but noone should be above it. Not even the ""representatives of God"".  Embed Quote"

They just can't voice their opposition easily because they'd be shut up by the louder members. I've also noticed that in case you happen to have the misfortune of being in an area with several mosques, they'll often get into a loudness war with each other, which ends badly for the listeners in the crossfire and secondly, for all the emphasis on having a set time for prayer, they are always out of sync with each other.Interestingly, my grandfather told me (he was opposed to them), that when loudspeakers first came in the imams were really opposed to them saying the prayers were to be called out by humans not electrical equipment and that this would reduce the effectiveness of the prayers.  Embed Quote"

YES, IMPOLITE. Several reasons: (1) if it is a multi-seat public restroom you put others at risk of overhearing your conversation unwillingly, and being uncomfortable. (2) You put the other person on the phone at risk of disclosure of things he or she is saying, without notice.  If it is a one-seater public restroom you run the risk of making an innocent person wait longer to use it, while you monopolize it as your phone booth. Also impolite.In your own home, IF the person on the other end of the phone has no idea where you are or what you are doing, and you manage the sound effects in such a way that they are not audible to the person on the other end, then whatever else you may have done you have not been rude. But you can't really be sure that you HAVE successfully managed all of the concealment; often bathrooms have a peculiar echo that other rooms lack, and so the audio may have given you away and made your conversational partner uneasy even if you did your best to avoid it. When you can't know for sure that you are sparing uneasiness to the other person, the polite choice is to not put them into that position. So I would say that while the risk of actual humiliation of the other party is lower when you do a call from your home toilet, it is still something a polite person should avoid.  Embed QuoteAnswered in forty-one minutes via  Rodrigo Estrada Gil."

Def-Coning isn't impolite as long as you follow the right etiquette and convention. The rules that apply to Telephonic Def-Cons are a simple extension of the rules for regular Face-to-Face(!) Def-Cons. These are the rules that must be strictly observed:#1 Full disclosure - The first rule of Def-Con is that you absolutely MUST talk about Def-Con. It is extremely imperative to declare that you are in a Def-Con before starting the conversation. This is done so as to not keep the person on the other end guessing about your sighs and sounds (not to mention the weird echoes and the changing amplitude and frequency of your voice). Not declaring this would not just be rude but also dishonest. If the listener indicates that s/he'd not like to continue the conversation given the circumstances, you must disconnect ASAP.#2 Limit your detail - Def-Con is not just a science. It is also an art that requires a fine balance of detail and discretion (aside from the finer balance of conversation and defecation). While you must let the listener know that you are in a Def-Con to seek approval, you MUST NOT give them any specific information or details pertaining to your predicament. Mentioning shape, color, size or any other attributes of defecation related entities is strictly No-No. If at any time, the listener indicates any discomfort with your level of detail you must disconnect ASAP. #3 No scatological references - Continuing with our theme of avoiding ambiguity, you MUST NOT use any scatological references or phrases that leave the listener guessing about your intent. Contextually ambiguous phrases like 'Oh crap!', 'What shit is this?', 'Are you shitting me?' and the like are a complete No-No since they lead to ambiguity given the circumstance!#4 No public Def-Cons - Def-Cons MUST be conducted in the privacy of your own restroom. You must not conduct Def-Cons in public restrooms or in other people's restrooms without their explicit approval. Stephanie's answer explains this better.#5 Only 1:1 Def-Cons - Def-Cons MUST only be used for One-to-one conversations and NOT for group conversations, meetings or conferences. It is okay for both the involved parties to be defecating at the same time (in fact that's the recommended setting for an ideal Def-Con).  One-to-Many or Many-to-Many(!) Def-Cons are NOT considered appropriate under any circumstances!Other than these, the basic etiquette and manners of regular conversations also apply to Def-Con.  Embed Quote"

Also, I don't know that much about other brands, I could imagine modern commuter jets are more quiet (Embraer, CRJ etc). As turboprop aircraft are also commercial aircraft, we should include these as well - and here, the engine noise is usually more dominant than relative wind speed noise.Most of the noise inside the cabin of a jet aircraft at cruise altitude is from the aircraft moving through the air at high speed. You can hardly hear the engines on a jet in cruise, of course, depending on where you sit. At the back of an MD-80/90 series aircraft, you definitely CAN hear the engines.On the flight deck, there is a lot of real estate straight into the relative wind, and a lot of that is glass. At 10000 feet, we normally accelerate from 250 knots indicated airspeed, to something like 300 to 350 knots, depending on type, weight, cost index and so on. During this transition it is quite clear to hear the effect of speed on the wind noise inside the flight deck.Personally, I use made-to-fit ear plugs, and they help a LOT. People don't realise HOW noisy it is, because the transition is so gradual.Some aircraft designs have tried to use opposite phase sound systems, like the principle used in noise cancelling headphones.  Embed Quote"

Do you get used to the noise? Nervous about a plane crashing into your house?,"I lived about two miles from the end of Glasgow Airport in Scotland for about seven years. The planes passed directly over head and the shadows would be visible in the garden as they went past.The noise depends allot on the direction of the aircraft - something that the other answers here haven't mentioned. Aircraft usually take off and land facing into the wind. If the wind changes, then they will switch the direction of travel.If you are on the take off side of the operation, the noise is minimal. Although the engines are a full power, the aircraft climb quickly and so are high above when they pass. You do here quite a bit of noise from them landing as reverse thrusters are common on most large aircraft and that can create a noise like thunder but no aircraft is in sight.If you are on the landing side, then noise is more noticeable. Landing aircraft come in low and slow and as such are much close to you than taking off aircraft. However, they are throttled down low and you don't here the reverse thrusters so much when they kick in.I was fortunate in that the prevailing winds kept me on the take off side of the airport most of the time. Perhaps one day in ten the weather would put me on the landing side.Another weather factor is the rain. With low clouds and rain, the noise made by jets changes. Rather than a roar it becomes a high whine. This wet weather noise seemed to penetrate into the house more than the fine weather noise.As for fear of crashes - such events are extremely rare. A pilot has options to crash land in open fields and a football pitch that surround my house. It would have to be an incredibly bad loss of control to create a situation where they couldn't avoid me. Then it would have to be a considerable fluke of bad luck that the aircraft is on a perfect alignment and trajectory towards my house and not a bit to the side or over the top. So no, I never worried. Now I live in a different city with no civilian airport, but a large military airport. The military flights are much less than the civilian airport and I am not directly on the flight path, but the noise from the military jets is much more than the civilian ones. You can here the military jets throughout the entire city when they pass, even at altitude you still notice them.  Embed Quote"

Nervous about a plane crashing into your house?,"I lived in the northern part of Richmond, BC, Canada right under the flight path of landing planes at Vancouver International for 12 years. You get used to it very quickly. Some days there would be a plane every minute (sometimes planes looked like they were just floating there... I never understood how they did that). It's awesome seeing planes come in and out from your bedroom window or having the shadows of airplanes pass an entire block in seconds. You become more familiar and fascinated by them rather than annoyed. There are times when it'll shake the whole house but it never bothered me. It made me wonder what kind of plane it was if anything. The noise never bothered anybody in my neighbourhood and they were VERY low to the ground. My friends and family who weren't from the area noticed every single plane. I moved away and came back, and noticed every plane as well. If you're not easily irritated, it should only take a couple months to get used to. If you are easily irritated, you're going to be the crankiest person in the neighbourhood.In the 12 years I lived there, I believe there were 2 fatal plane accidents. Both were small cessnas. One crashed into a condo tower and the other crashed into a parking lot. Both were due to poor weather conditions.  Embed Quote"

If in close proximity, the field will couple. If not, it's more likely to simply radiate.Capacitances are never perfect. A poor analogy could be made with friction: If there was none, you would be unable to propel forward by walking. Likewise, a capacitor would simply be unable to release its stored charge (let's leave the solid state physics out of it)Electrons in a radiated field travel in a direct path towards your signal path. Good shielding practice prevents most of it, but even i don't know what's good shielding practice.A better solution is to use balanced signal cables that deliver the hot and antiphase on two wires. in the input end, a differential amplifier combines those and subtracts the pure noise out of the signal. This only works if both cables are of the same type and length, so use a decent XLR cables. Contemporary studio electronics should deliver this, but many conventional instrument chains don't (ex: guitar stompbox-type effects)Removing absolutely all noise is a difficult process, and will not necessarily guarantee better results. You could record in a full annechoic chamber, but depending on where and how your cables and setup is, you may not get a better signal to noise ratio. by definition, whenever you use compression your SNR is worsened.on a funnier note, recording in a chamber where you can hear your heartbeat is unbearable, as the musician needs to play much softer than they are used to.  Embed Quote"

On the flip side there are many documented stories and explanations from qualified physicists and health professionals that raise doubt on the use of Wifi. As I have read Wifi works on the same principles as microwaves in a microwave oven. Whilst the waves are negligibly lower to that of a microwave oven it is the fact that the waves produce a thermal warming effect which no doubt exposes us in the process. According to organisations such as the WHO these waves would have to produce serious effects such as burning before considered to be dangerous to humans.

Rather, John Harvard’s adoring visitors endow the ritual with meaning. Harvard students do not pee on the statue in spite of its significance. They pee on the statue because of its significance. Urinating on the monument to higher education in America is a bizarre attempt at self-affirmation. It says: ""Not only do I go to Harvard, but I spit, nay, pee, on it as well.""I imagine that students from other schools pee on the statue as a manifestation of their insecurity towards Harvard as an institution and towards its students.I think AT Harvard it's sometimes seen as a ""good luck"" move also; perhaps getting away with it emboldens the soul.Or maybe everyone who does it is just really drunk.  Embed QuoteAnswered in two minutes."

But as one of my favorite shows, MythBusters, proved, the electric charge has to have a way to reach from the fence to your, um, genitals. They tested it with an electrified third rail, but it is roughly the same thing as far as the concept is concerned. Urine streams usually are not a steady stream, and instead it is often separated by blank space. This is clearly seen in high-speed footage on the show. But if the charge is high enough, it is possible that the electricity could bridge the gaps in the urine stream and travel all the way up to the source. If that happens, the result would be ""rather shocking"".My personal recommendation: Don't pee on electric fences, or anything electric for that matter.  Embed Quote"

You can avoid the pharmacist's confussion on the amount or kind of drugs. The other good thing is the information leaflet (called prospecto here) wich can be consulted by the patient at any time. Very usefull when the patient has doubts about side effects and other things when they can't go to the pharmacy or the doctor's office to ask (for example if it's late at night). The bad part of this system is when you need to take 14 pills and the boxes have 10 pills for example. You have to buy 2 boxes, wasting money and medication. We don't have the refill option either. So you need to get a lot of prescriptions in advance or go to the doctor every time you need a new one. I don't know how it works in other countries.  I still think that avoiding human mistakes that can lead to serious problems and even death makes the european system the best choice.Not for Reproduction"

However, I would hesitate to say that this reduced risk would make the European system better. Mathematically more sound, perhaps, and less of a liability, perhaps, but better?As far as I can tell: by having the pill distributor package the pills themselves, we could assume an increase in labor and cost. However, thanks to the socialized medical communities in some of those countries, that doesn't mean that purchasing the pills would necessarily cost more (at the pharmacy, that is). As far as the United States is concerned, the pharmaceutical companies are pretty much able to charge whatever they want, so prices are going to be higher. The real issue, though, is whether either method improves and/or ensure proper use of the medicine. Once the package, whether it's individually packaged, or put into a pill bottle and given away like that, leaves the building, it's equally liable to be misused in any manner. In the end, to me, neither system seems better than the other. Honestly, as it stands, I would stick with the United States system on the basis that while there may be a slightly greater margin for error, there is also more opportunity to actually speak with pharmacists and their assistants, as opposed to just having a box handed to you.  Embed QuoteVia  Fred Landis."

No matter how many per day I should take, I could consistently be sure that I'd taken them (or not).As for cost? Well, I guess my self-employed shop-owning pharmacist is a specialised skill, at about half the rate of a lawyer; at least same as a plumber or mechanic.

On the flip side, you might have higher costs in Europe for packaging needs and, thus, a greater overhead on shipping as a result of increased weight of bulk packaging.However, I'd say that none of those differences make either system better than the other, and that they're comparable.  Embed QuoteVia  Fred Landis."

Many, many studies have demonstrated lasting changes to the serotonergenic systems in both animals and humans, leading to impaired memory, cognition, and emotions.As a counterpoint, neither LSD or psilocybin has been show to be neurotoxic in any studies. This is not a biased, but an objective opinion based on review of a large number of recent studies.A number of studies have shown that injecting rats with large doses of anti-oxidants prevents neurotoxicity, indicating a few things:The neurotoxicity is almost certainly real, since it can be reduced in a predictable manner with anti-oxidants, without diminishing the acute effects of the drug.Neurotoxicity is likely caused by the presence of oxidative chemicals following MDMA use, likely MDMA, a metabolite, or dopamine.Neurotoxicity can possibly be prevented with antioxidants, though this has not been proven in humans, and in rats only with extremely high intravenous (not oral) doses.In short, there is no safe way to take MDMA.  MDMA is neurotoxic. There are theoretical ways to reduce neurotoxicity in humans, but they have not been proven in either human studies, nor in animals with normal doses taken orally.You may read that one major study on MDMA was retracted because of terribly flawed methodology, namely that the study was mistakenly done with methamphetamine. That is true. However there are scores of other credible studies indicating physiological damage to brains, neurotoxicity, and serious cognitive damage in animals and humans. You may also hear that damage is caused by tainted pills - this is categorically false, as numerous analyses of seized MDMA pills have found little or no evidence of other harmful chemicals in street bought MDMA.Search for ""MDMA brain damage"" and you will not only find these studies, but hundreds of anecdotal reports of disastrous effects from relatively minor usage. Do the same search for ""LSD brain damage"" and you will find little if any scientific or anecdotal evidence of lasting damage.Personal OpinionI am not an opponent of drug use in general. Smoke pot in moderation. Take LSD or mushrooms on occasion if you want a spiritual experience, though those drugs are not without risk of long term behavioral effects. Coke out in vegas, just don't get hooked. But don't risk your life and mind on MDMA. If you do, research ""pre"" and ""post"" rolling as that may help protect you, don't do it more than once every few months, and don't take it multiple times in a short period as that greatly increases the risk.  Embed Quote"

Or maybe his shop out in the backyard. If this was known information the DEA would have already shut it down.I would guess it would be produced in an area where methylamine has legitimate uses. Its been a long time since I studied the MDMA synthesis, but if I remember correctly, the common way its made is through the luekart-wallach reaction of methylenedioxyphenylacetone with methylamine.So it would likely be made where those might be easier to get. But MDPAc really isn't available anywhere, so it needs to be synthesized before the main reaction. This needs to be made using a few difficult to aquire chemicals like sassafras oil, piperonal and benzaldehyde if I remember right, but I am afraid that my knowledge of the procedure to make MDPAc ends here. In fact I am probably mistaken about everything I've said about MDPAc production.If I really cared I could probably figure out an easier way to make it by starting with methylenedioxyephedrine which would be reduced to MDMA using the birch reduction or reducing with hydriodic acid and phosphorus. Methylenedioxyephedrine shouldn't be too difficult to make, and some clever underground chemist may have figured this out somewhere. I am just guessing here, I don't know if anyone does this, but its possible.My guess is that it is made in a rural area, since the production of MDMA produces fumes that are very noticable. The chemicals needed to make it are likely more available in rural areas. I would assume that a secluded home with a barn or large garage that isn't easily seen from any main roads and is at least half a mile away from any neighbors would be the most likely place that the MDMA comes from.  Embed Quote"

These are the most pleasant days and are sunny too. But the heavy cloudy days building up to rain can be quite high in pollution levels. But remember, when that rain is falling, it's carrying everything in the Beijing air with it. Wash your clothes as soon as you can, I've had a rain soaked white shirt left unwashed overnight and now it's been permanently stained with blacksih spots. Wash it off your skin as soon as you can.Enjoy Beijing, and cherish the days where the sun shines brightly on a blue sky  Embed Quote"

When Beijing has good air quality days it's lovely, but on bad air quality days (which are the majority)…well, here are some photos I took:And here's a collage from Weibo of 365 consecutive days of sky photos.The point being, Beijing's air pollution should be taken seriously. Download an air quality index (AQI) app, keep track of the air where you are, and react appropriately when pollution is bad. When the pollution is bad, this means avoiding physical exercise, not burning candles indoors (even though the air is stinky), keeping the windows shut, and having your air filters on.My wife and I did the following:Bought air purifiers for the home.You don't need to spend a fortune on an air filter. You can even build your own: How to Make a DIY Air Purifier.We started out with a generic HEPA filter from Midea. We changed the filters every three months instead of every six; we could tell when it was time to change because the air flow from the front vents would be noticably lower. Gross.The morning after we bought the filter was the first time since moving to Beijing that I didn't wake up with a sore throat from having a runny nose all night. I was sold.This filter did fine, but we eventually upgraded to a BlueAir. I didn't notice any difference between it and the Midea; I just kept not having a cough or a sore throat from the pollution. The BlueAir was nice, though, because it was quieter than the Midea, and we got it at a great price.Now, expats in Beijing love to talk air purifiers and show off their latest, expensive, buy, but I think that you're fine buying any HEPA purifier that can change the air in the room 3+ times/hour. I know others have argued that BlueAir &c are better because of the pre-filtering that takes out chemical fumes from construction and renovation, but if your apartment is full of formaldehyde fumes, maybe you should move.Bought those air-cleaning plants everyone talks about.Do they work? There's quite a bit of research to indicate they do, but I thought the effect (if any) from the plants we bought was much less noticeable than that of our HEPA filter. According to one source (which has a great list of NASA-approved plants for purifying the air), NASA research indicated you should have one plant per 10m^2 of floorspace, so be prepared to buy quite a few. The plants that we had be best luck with was mother-in-law's tongue. They are still going strong after three years.Luckily, most of these air cleaning plants are ubiquitous and cheap, so go to the flower market next to the US Embassy and have fun shopping and haggling over plants. If you want to buy large plants, try to get them from the same seller, as delivery will be included in the price.Bought a totobobo mask.This was sort of a low point of living in Beijing, acceding to the idea that to go outside I really should wear a mask to breathe. However, life was better with the mask than without it, so I wore the damn thing.When you are looking at pollution masks, there are two things to keep in mind: filtering ability and fit. If the mask isn't able to filter fine particles (the lingo most often heard about this is ""N95""), it's worthless. The cloth masks you see people wearing don't do anything for pollution. Similarly, if the mask doesn't have a tight, consistent seal to your face, dirty air leaks in and the mask isn't as effective.We bought totobobo masks, which are great because (a) you can cut them to fit your face, ensuring proper fit, and (b) they have replaceable filters. On bad air quality days, our air filters would go grey after an hour of outdoor wear. (Think about that for a little bit…) This is a photo of my mask with new filters after an hour of wear on an AQI 300+ day.  The main downside to the totobobo is that moisture accumulates inside it. After about an hour of wear I'd need to take it off and swab out the inside.We have left Beijing, mostly because of the air pollution. The government says that it should have the problem fixed in ""five to ten years"". I'm skeptical of that, but hope it's true.  Embed Quote"

I'm the nerd that did all the home air experiments and started Particle Counting. I started to get really concerned about air pollution during the ""airpocalypse,"" but I was shocked at having to spend $1,000 on a single air purifier (let alone the replacement filters). So I researched how filters work and made my own. I posted all of my data and tests online, for example: 1. Live test of the filter2. Tests showing the DIY filter gets an average of 84% of particles larger than .5 microns and 92% of particles larger than 2.5 microns3. Tests of a newer, stronger model that gets 96% of both!Instructions on how to make one are on the Tumblr. However, several people told me they were having trouble finding the parts, so I've started ordering in bulk and shipping from Smart Air. My hope is that my nerd-ery can help people stay healthy without giving a wheelbarrow full of cash to filter companies.And Luke, you're right--particles aren't everything. If people are concerned about fumes from construction, you can add an activated carbon filter to the DIY pretty easily.  Embed Quote"

Being in a car with no windows open makes a HUGE difference on your air quality. I learned that from a UN researcher in an Environment of China class. When pollution measures are off the charts (which happens a couple times a month), avoid going outside altogether. This might sound extreme, but if you plan on living in Beijing for years plural, its important. Lung related illnesses are the number one cause of death in Beijing. To know when the weather is bad, get a VPN and follow @beijingair on Twitter. It's a device that measures pollution by parts per million and I believe its on top of the US embassy in Beijing. It's also worthwhile to understand what the measures mean. The smaller the particles, the worse for your lungs. Everyone was freaking out with all the construction dust before the Olympics, but that just makes your boogers blacks, not a big deal.  Embed Quote"

In the process, they release oxygen (O2) for us to breathe.Trees:Help to settle out, trap and hold particle pollutants (dust, ash, pollen and smoke) that can damage human lungs.Absorb CO2 and other dangerous gasses and, in turn, replenish the atmosphere with oxygen.Produce enough oxygen on each acre for 18 people every day.Absorb enough CO2 on each acre, over a year's time, to equal the amount you produce when you drive your car 26,000 miles. Trees remove gaseous pollutants by absorbing them through the pores in the leaf surface. Particulates are trapped and filtered by leaves, stems and twigs, and washed to the ground by rainfall.Air pollutants injure trees by damaging their foliage and impairing the process of photosynthesis (food making). They also weaken trees making them more susceptible to other health problems such as insects and diseases.The loss of trees in our urban areas not only intensifies the urban ""heat-island"" effect from loss of shade and evaporation, but we lose a principal absorber of carbon dioxide and trapper of other air pollutants as well.Some of the major air pollutants and their primary sources are:Carbon dioxide: Burning oil, coal, natural gas for energy. Decay and burning of tropical forests.Sulfur dioxide: Burning coal to generate electricity.Hydrogen floride and silicon tetrafloride: Aluminum and phospate fertilizer production, oil refineries, and steel manufacturing.Ozone: Chemical reactions of sunlight on automobile exhaust gases. Ozone is a major pollutant in smog.Methane: Burning fossil fuels, livestock waste, landfills and rice production.Nitros oxides: Burning fossil fuels and automobile exhausts.Chloroflorocarbons: Air conditioners, refrigerators, industrial foam.The burning of fossil fuels for energy and large scale forest fires such as in the tropics are major contributors to the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere.Managing and protecting forests and planting new trees reduces CO2 levels by storing carbon in their roots and trunk and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.[3]Reference:Forest Service Study Finds Urban Trees Removing Fine Particulate Air Pollution, Saving Lives.Trees Reduce Air PollutionTrees Capture Particulate Matter From Road ExhaustModeled PM2.5 removal by trees in ten U.S. ci...

However, I'm going to speak from a North American perspective (Hong Kong, as Anonymous points out, has different sources of air pollution, given 90% of people take transit there already). I argue that land use, not public transit, plays a bigger factor in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Without proper land use, you can have lots of buses go any where, but they wouldn't be able to meet the right ridership since everything is far apart. As Seth Andrzejewski points out, land use is very critical. Your goal: you want to be able to reduce the travel time from your origin to your place of destination, so you choose the mode of transportation that is the least costly, from a time and monetary perspective. You want to reduce the time it takes to take to get to work or buy groceries. For example, if you can make the places between where you live and the places you want to go (grocery store, work, park, etc.) closer to each other, you make it a lot easier to depend on the car, since things are not spread out. If things are too spread out, the Golden Triangle of Transit here fails:From Jarrett Walker, international transit consultant: (Human Transit: basics: conceptual triangles).In short, without the right density and walk-ability, transit services can't justify frequent services (buses coming every five minutes!) or have the right ridership to meet the service. This is why in a lot of suburbs, you have buses coming every 30 minutes or hour: it is much more cheaper for them to take that route because not many people take transit.Without proper land use planning (which is a whole other subject on its own, as the comments on Seth's post point out), like in the US, you have a lot of suburbs, which makes it more convenient to drive than to take transit.  Jarrett Walker, from his book, Human Transit: How clearer thinking about public transit can enrich our communities and our lives (see here: human transit (the book): introduction ) notes that if land use (""development"") is spread out, transit would not be very efficient:The red line is the transit line, the dark purples are the first and last stops, and the light purple are the intermediate stops. If we pretended, this was a suburb, having cul-de sacs (in light purple) would not be very efficient for transit vehicles because  the bus/rail would have to go through every destination. It would take a really long time for that red line to go to every place. This is a different transit line, but much more straight forward. Now, with the proper land use that is very dense in one line, this can be a very efficient transit line. This is key: proper land use. You can still have a straight line but it can be located in the suburbs, and it would be an inefficient transit line because there is not enough ridershipHere's an example of density, visualized, from the architecture firm, Perkins & Will, of a urban design plan for Vancouver, Canada, I believe. Here's another similar image of Vancouver, probably at a different location:Watch that transit line pass through that dense neighborhood! With the amount of development, it will have a justifiable amount of ridership to justify frequent service along the line to take transit!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, in short, land use, not public transit, in North America, has a greater factor in influencing greenhouse gas emissions.Note: you might have noticed that I was sort of repetitive in different ways. It is really important to be clear when discussing or talking about transportation and the language of transportation because people interpret things different ways. That's why I provided lots of different visuals from different sources to help put everything in context.  The concept of density, for example, is a very broad concept. Does it mean 5 story, 10 story, 80 story (Manhattan), etc. There are different ways of measuring high density. Similarly, the concept of mixed land use or closer land uses is also very hard to visualize and thus has to be explained in depth to the reader.This is the role of urban planners, transportation engineers, and also to a growing extent, the smart cities / big data movement, which I talk more about in this article: http://www.quora.com/Smart-Citie...  Embed Quote"

There are many other sources of air pollution, not just from autos. I couldn't immediately find a % breakdown of where air pollution comes from, mainly because it's an apples to oranges comparison. Factories or refineries emit different pollutants than autos.2. The ""public transport"" solution shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a public transport problem. The real problem is how many American cities are organized - where people live, work, and shop. Take ""auto-centric"" Los Angeles for example. It does have a metro, metrorapid bus, and light rail system, mostly serving downtown. For commuting patterns between these points (i.e. from Hollywood to Downtown along the Red Line), there may be a significant transit mode share (say >20%). However, public transport would have to bridge a huge number of possible origin-destination combinations to make a serious dent in auto generated air pollution. People live in Torrence and work to Pasadena, live in Long Beach and work in Santa Monica. It would be much less expensive if we could convince people to live nearer to where they worked.  Embed Quote"

There are two approaches to this, eliminating dust at the source, and eliminating it at the intake. I'd start with stopping it at the source. Cutting and machining metals with a lubricating coolant will improve the quality of the work, make your tools last longer, and eliminate airborne dust. Do this first. For operations which must be done dry, arrange for dust collection. Be careful of fine aluminum powder. It can be hazardous! Finally, protect yourself with a dust mask.

Danger! Dust may form flammable or explosive mixture with air, especially when damp. Reacts violently and/or explosively with water, steam or moisture. May ignite or explode on contact with moist air. May cause eye and skin irritation. May cause respiratory tract irritation. Air sensitive.Target Organs: Lungs, eyes, skin.Potential Health Effects     Eye:          May cause eye irritation.      Skin:          May cause skin irritation. Low hazard for usual industrial handling.           No sensitizing effects known.      Ingestion:          May cause gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, vomiting and           diarrhea.      Inhalation:          May cause respiratory tract irritation. May cause respiratory           difficulty and coughing.      Chronic:          Aluminum may be implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Inhalation of           aluminum containing dusts may cause pulmonary disease.So basically, it would seem to be a Bad Idea to expose yourself to aluminum dust on a regular basis.  A dust mask would be a wise choice.  Get one that will filter the correct size of particles.MSDS Aluminum Metallic Powder: Page on Iastate.edu  Embed QuoteVia  Ben Mordecai."

Although breathing aluminium dust is not advisable for health reasons, there are much greater dangers associated with sanding, cutting, grinding, deburring and finishing of aluminium parts. The most serious risk arises when aluminium and steel (or stainless steel parts) are worked on in the same area. Mixing aluminium and steel dust creates a potential for combustion (an explosion or a fire) when an ignition source (a spark) ignites the airborne or settled dust particles. To mitigate this risk, ferrous and non-ferrous metals should not be operated on in the same area and the different dusts should be collected using separate dust collectors or downdraft tables. An alternative way to capture combustible dusts such as Aluminium, Titanium, Magnesium etc. is to use a wet dust collector which safely captures combustible dust and complies with all NFPA and OSHA standards. To specifically answer your question, above all else, make sure that you are not breathing in any fumes from stainless steel welding. Although all welding fumes are toxic and cause health problems, fumes from welding on stainless steel produce Hexavalent Chromium, a known carcinogen which can cause lung cancer, immunity disorders, neurodegenerative disorders... Hexavalent chromium. Welders working on stainless steel must use a fume extractor with a HEPA filter to comply with OSHA standards.My suggestions relating to your question:Capture dust and smoke at source with the correct air filtration equipment If not feasible, ventilate the shop with ambient air cleaners/ exhaust systems Workers exposed to the aluminium dust should wear masks/ respirators  I have linked to some videos below on the hazards of combustible dust:Shameless plug :D  Embed Quote"

I've highlighted the actual data multiple times on my blog, including this post here: How Good are N95 Masks For Pollution?.  The key is ""N95"" or better -- this literally is a US-government certification that tested the mask and demonstrated 95% decrease (or better) in blocking particulate matter (PM) smaller than 2.5 -- or even smaller, at 0.3 microns. Europe has a different rating system. These systems started for work safety mostly in construction sites (dust, paint fumes etc) and the 3M company is the most reputable US company making these masks. This is why all the good research studies use a 3M mask as a ""gold standard"" masks. This is also why I recommend them over any other mask. By the way, we focus on PM2.5 and not gases or other toxins because it's felt that PM2.5 causes the most health problems compared to the other pollutants. A particle smaller than 2.5 microns is easily breathed in and directly absorbed into your bloodstream, starting the pro-inflammatory cascade which leads to all the bad health effects. So do N95 masks work? There are a couple studies recently which demonstrate effectiveness in wearing a mask and improving heart rate, blood pressure and also blood markers of inflammation (CRP and others).

[Environ Health Perspect. 2012] The first study is here: Beneficial cardiovascular effects of reducing exposure to particulate air pollution with a simple facemask  This is the best evidence so far that a good mask can help decrease exposure and actually help protect your health. Hopefully, better long term studies will be more convincing. But I certainly think the evidence is sound, and it's more than logical to use a proper N95 mask anytime the air is bad. I personally recommend using a mask anytime the AQI is over 200 -- which happens all the time here. As for brands -- a great issue. On my blog I compared the two more popular brands Respro and the newer Totobobo: Respro Vs. Totobobo: Which Mask Works Better For Air Pollution? I actually prefer Totoboto because they are the only consumer version that I am aware of which has published actual real world fit-test results, showing more than 99% effectiveness against PM0.3: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubm... Respro claims 88% effectiveness but didn't provide me with the actual independent test. This is why I recommend Totobobo over Respro. As for other brands, many other new companies are claiming their material is 95-99% effective, which is great -- but what about the real world, with the mask on a face? Because air leakage and a proper fit is crucial. What good is 99% if tons of air leaks around it? This again is why I always prefer the tried and true 3M brand as the ""gold standard"", and then the Totobobo and Respro types. Don't even bother with a cotton mask or even those blue/green surgical masks, they are 30-70% effective at best.  Embed QuoteAnswered in thirty-one minutes."

I curse myself daily for being born in a hindu family.,"Chill, dude.Pollution is not anywhere in the top 10 list of horrible things about Hinduism in particular, or religions (all of them) in general. There are people out there killing other people in the name of religion (and this is true of most major religions of the world). Do you really want to get worked up over pollution?As to why this is a part of Hinduism, the simple answer is that this made much more sense 2500 years ago when these rituals were probably first practiced. In those days, with much lower populations, and societies living close to nature, pollution was not a problem. Fire was what separated humans from the animals, and was great for purification, cooking and other ""good"" things. There was no electricity, or natural gas, so all heating required coal or wood.Some of these rituals don't make sense now - but the nature of religions (as most people follow them) makes it difficult to adapt to modern conditions.  All religions suffer from this problem of having to follow rituals and rules that made sense thousands of years ago, but don't any longer.And finally, do you really think that pollution due to havans is really a pressing problem? Have you tried to estimate how much of the pollution in India is caused by havans, and how much is caused by your motorcycle, and how much was caused by the factories that built the laptop and mobile phone you're using?  Embed Quote"

I curse myself daily for being born in a hindu family.,"As Navin Kabra rightly highlighted in his answer, the rituals were designed to serve a purpose but are not adapted to current living standards and environment.As far as havans/yagnas are concerned, it was/is considered a good thing to offer specific materials to the fire as the heating of them in certain proportion would cleanse the environment and have positive impact on the body and soul. The Rishis of those times were also experts in Ayurveda and other medicines. So they mostly came up with such rituals where positive effects of such havans can be reached to a good number of people. One such example is the bonfire at the night of Holi (Holika Dahan). Originated from a religious believes, this fire does cleanse the air from the insects that specifically originates in fields after winter harvest.So in some cases, the rituals were originally started to have a positive impact but probably over the time they might have become a reason for pollution. But again, how much is their contribution to over all rise of pollution in recent times?  Embed Quote"

I curse myself daily for being born in a hindu family.,"All religions worship the higher source/energy in the form of fire, seen as lighting candles or lamps during prayers. It’s an ancient method of submitting the pleas and prayers to the higher source beseeching their Divine blessings.Only difference is lighting candles and lamps have invisible toxic gases (CO2 and CO mainly) while Havan has visible fumes due to solid substances being burnt. and believe me these gases produced by lamps/candles are as toxic as burning any form of gasoline which is far worse than outcomes of Havan.Few images to prove what other religion followers are doing:Christians (candles/lamps):Shingon Buddism (fire):Islam (another form of pollution):So as every other religion has some ceremony you can call pollution until you do some research and get to real meaning of those acts.Coming back to Havan again:In fact Havan is performed as a personal ritual performed for the benefit of the society or the whole living beings.Havan(Homam) is not just burning some woods and eatables for sake of performing a typical ritual with no reasons. Though I am sure lot of people does not know the real benefits behind the act. Here are few facts about ingredients used in Havan and their benefits: 1. Havan Samagri(a mixture of various dried herbal medicines, roots and leaves) is offered in the blazed fire which disseminates in micro form, in the air, to purify the environment besides activating the air as disinfectant germicidal agent.2. Pure Ghee (Butter made from cow milk) is burned in fire which gets converted into micro form to purify damp air.3. Camphor (Kapoor):Camphor is used in almost all Havan ceremonies. Camphor is a cough suppressant which helps avoid cough to the people performing Havan as they have to sit next to fire during ceremony. Camphor will deter snakes and other reptiles due to its strong odor. Similarly, camphor is believed to be toxic to insects and is thus sometimes used as a repellent.There are many different thing which seem illogical at first but they make lot of sense when you go behind the real reasons.I am sure you will start feeling very blessed one day when you understand real essence behind Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism). Hinduism is not just a religion but it's a way of life!  Embed Quote"

bags are harming our environment; isn't it a no brainer they should not be made anymore?,"Because science. That's why. At least, that's why I oppose the bans. More specifically, I oppose the bans because:Plastic is not necessarily worse for the environment than paper bags. It's complicated and depends what tradeoffs and assumptions you make [1]. Yes, paper degrades, but it's also a lot bulkier. Guess what? All that bulk has to be transported... using lots and lots of gas. Paper also requires cutting down forests which kill trees and require more gas. Paper production is, generally speaking, a heavily polluting industry. You can certainly argue that paper is worse than plastic too. It's not clear cut. It's sort of like asking if it's better to eat fast food everyday or to smoke. Both are bad, but in very different ways so it depends on how you compare risk of cancer / lung problems to obesity. This is much like the paper vs. plastic debate, except there's even more factors to consider. Ultimately, you can argue equally well that either one is better or worse.Plastic is not necessarily worse for the environment than reusable cloth / canvas bags [2]. How could this be? Because plastic bags have less environmental impact per bag than reusable bags. This should be expected - reusable bags are way more durable, and thus take a lot more energy to produce. It's only through reuse that reusable bags compensate for their far, far greater environmental impact. The thing is though that reusable bags are reused an average of 50 times and it's looking like it takes 130+ or more reuses to compensate for the additional environmental impact of reusable bags. D'oh!Plastic bags are a lot more convenient. With a large load of groceries, the paper bags get very bulky. They fill up an entire [plastic!] trash bag by themselves. The handles are flimsy and tear. You can't carry as much in one, or carry as many bags at once. Plastic bags can be reused for lunch bags, dog poop, bathroom / small trash can liners, and other things. In many cases, not getting plastic bags ""for free"" at the grocery stores means going out and purchasing them instead.So, given equal (or equally unclear) harm or to the environment, I'll go with the more convenient option.The bans in particular frustrate me because they're a knee-jerk reaction based on false science that greatly inconvenience people. If you're going to ban plastic bags, then it needs to be very clear that they're substantially worse. That's just not the case. I'm all for getting serious about the environment and legislating some changes, but it needs to be actually better. It can't just be an assumption that takes into account only one factor (trash production).And, to make matters worse, people aren't focusing on where they could make a difference: educate people on recycling and make it more convenient. For example, why not require apartment buildings to have a recycling bin next to the mailboxes? Why not spend more effort educating people on what can be recycled? There is so much more work to be done here. I think these bans are focusing on the wrong areas.Some studies to get you started on paper vs. plastic vs. reusable bags:[1] Paper vs. Plastic: (a) Myth: Paper is Better Than Plastic (b) A New Look at the Bag Scourge[2] Disposable Bags vs. Reusable Bags:(a) A Survey on the Economic Effects of Los Angeles County’s Plastic Bag Ban, (b) Paper or Plastic?

Around the house, they can be used to contain lots of basic things, and are great poop insulators.  When we did not have unified ""one stop"" recycling, the bags didn't always get recycled, and we tried to reuse, but it wasn't very good.  Adding that service everywhere possible would do a lot of damage on the problem.  ""just put it in there, no worries"" type recycling is awesome!  If it's got the symbol, do it!  A fantastic number of things can be recycled now.  We've done the work, now we need to improve collections.Frankly, this is a great opportunity for somebody.  Make plastic bags, or something like plastic bags that reduce into something else, good for a coupla days, or weeks, and people would adopt them rapidly, assuming material properties that keep the benefits of the bags intact.And that's why!  The utility of the bags exceeds the pain perception of the problem.  Embed Quote"

Plastic bags aren't a one-dimensional environmental decision. Does it cost more to transport other bags besides plastic ones? How many saved plastic bags equal the amount of material required to produce a reusable bag or a paper bag? Even bundling everything together as an ""environmental decision"" is problematic. How much landfill space is equal to one gallon of diesel emissions? Do alternatives spend more fuel in the process than plastic bags? What percentage of plastic bags are recycled? Does recycling itself pose environmental hazards?The same thing happens frequently with bottled water. People are outraged over the extra packaging that is produced and thrown away and that we're shipping water across the country, but ultimately... no one is upset about doing the same thing with Coke or Pepsi. So shipping and packaging water is terrible because of its environmental effects, but if you carbonate it and add corn syrup and flavoring then it's forgivable?Disclosure: I work in the packaging industry, but my company has no stake in the choice of paper vs. plastic vs. reusable packaging.  Embed Quote"

They introduced a mandatory charge of 5 pence (10 cents) per bag.Some consumers saw this as an extra tax or way to make money but the majority supported the idea. Clerks have to ask customers how many bags they want and remind them there is a charge.82% of Welsh shoppers bring their own multi-use bags to do their groceries [2]. This is a major behavioural change. Those that used the single use bags used less, opting to pack the bags more efficiently.It turns out that associating a cash value to plastic bags led to a major shift in the way people thought about them. They were no longer free and worthless, but an expense that can be avoided.I noticed when I moved to San Francisco that there were no plastic bags and instead they used these huge thick brown paper (actually more like card) bags. I was not impressed. This is like replacing one vice with another. Better to incentivise bringing your own bag.[1] Carrier bag reduction up to 90%[2] Bag charge 'can help all of UK'  Embed Quote"

I just want to present 1 observation from my life to point out a positive externality of plastic bags.I remember when I was a kid and I lived with my grandparents for a while the situation with the garbage was the following:My grandma had a plastic bucket and all garbage went there. Roughly once a day (or once in 2 days) we took that bucket out and in big metal containers that were serviced by garbage trucks. And 90% of the people did that.TODAYEveryone is packaging their garbage into the bags, To the end point this doesn't matter (the garbage either gets dumped on special sites, or burnt or recycled) BUT to the city that makes a massive difference. Most of the garbage is ""prepacked"" therefore there is much less of it lying around.We buy food from the store, we put that food in the plastic bags, we then use those bags for garbage packaging - its a very efficient system!Thus no one wants to abandon it.  Embed Quote"

My concern is that this is just another knee-jerk environmentally motivated response that seems like the right thing intuitively but may not be better at all. Like hybrid cars or corn ethanol. The two problems we're trying to solve, as I understand them, are pollution and energy consumption. Carbon is on everyone's list of pollution issues (those who think there is a problem, anyway) but the chances that the energy to make anything comes from carbon based sources are so overwhelming I'm just assuming carbon footprint is a wash. Does a plastic bag ban solve the pollution problem? Not really. Yes, you'll see fewer paper or cloth bags on the side of the road. But most of our garbage winds up as pollution anyway - just because we localize the pollution in huge landfills or dump it where no one can see it doesn't mean it actually goes away. It just goes away from you. And those tissue paper thin plastic bags degrade faster than paper.Take a good look at that fabric bag your grocer just sold you for a dollar. Cheaply made of non-renewable materials. Might last you a year of regular use, if you're lucky. And what happens to it then? It ends up in the landfill right next to most of the plastic bags, which will be gone long before it is. Yes, the $10 bags they sell at Whole Foods last a lot longer, and are made of natural fibers. But that isn't what most people are using for ""reusable grocery bags"". No one has ever cut down a hardwood forest so they could plant trees for pulp. They plant trees for pulp after the hardwood has been cleared and sold. Paper doesn't cause old growth deforestation. As for energy, do we know how much energy it takes to make a plastic bag? A paper bag? A fabric bag? Someone does, but the people passing these laws don't.If we're really trying to save the planet, lets take a minute and see what the consequences of our decisions are going to be before we jump in to these things.  Embed Quote"

Plastic bags are convenient and ubiquitous. Even those who pay attention and recognize the environmental impact still don't think about it before they walk into a store. Someone who remembers with a cart half full of groceries isn't likely to walk back out to get a bag from the car.I doubt that most stores have any interest in curtailing plastic bag use. We live in a society where purchasing habits have been carefully studied and scrutinized (see Paco Underhill's books on the subject) to optimize store layouts and attend to any little detail of shopping that might potentially interfere with our buying everything in sight impulsively, without a second thought to whether or not we actually need it or can afford it. It is in the stores' interest to make the shopping experience as frictionless as possible, which includes keeping lines short, as well as happily handing out advertising-laden bags to convey the new purchases home. They are not now free, but the charge is figured into the cost of our purchases at some point. Occasionally, it is refunded if we bring our own bags, but I wonder whether most stores really want customers wandering around with opaque canvas bags. (Aside: when I bring my bag, I sometimes use it in lieu of a cart or basket. I buy less that way, which is certainly not what the stores want. I am limited to what I can easily carry, which is important to me if I arrived on foot—not exactly a typical suburban behavior. If I were a store manager, though, I expect I would just see one more potential means of shoplifting each time a canvas bag walked in.)For those shoppers who bother to notice and think about it, there is another sort of justification. How bad, goes the reasoning, could my one or two bags be? We can recycle them, right? Of course, the problem isn't that there are one or two bags, but that there are one or two bags per person, per purchase, times billions of people times thousands of purchases.Yet the day-to-day consumer sees only a few bags at a time. S/he does not see the volume of bags generated by even a single store for a single day (much less a world's worth of stores over the course of decades), or the great garbage patches in the ocean. S/he does not see the fact that there is truly no ""away"" in ""throw away,"" or the still relatively minuscule percentage of bags that actually do get recycled, or the energy and resources that went into manufacturing the bags in the first place.S/he sees, instead, that bags are there (as they always have been), they are free, they are pretty handy for carrying stuff and keeping wet and sticky stuff from messing up the car, that one or two aren't really so bad. Besides, they're handy for lining the trash can and picking up after the dog. If the public is so opposed to plastic bag bans (how presumptuous of our government to try to tell us what is good for us!), a good intermediate measure would be to charge a small but noticeable fee per bag, perhaps 25¢. They would be there for those who really do still need them, but it would be an incentive for people to bring back bags, and to think twice about double bagging and bagging fewer items in each bag. Here's how it works in Sweden. A store customer may buy a bag by picking it up in front of the check stand and adding it to his or her order. It is rung up like any other item. These bags are generally a little larger and sturdier than the bags here, so fewer are needed, they invite reuse, and they hold up to taking the train or bus home. The purchases, once scanned, are placed in a divided tray behind the checker. Someone (usually the customer, after paying) bags the groceries. The checker then slides the tray divider to the other side and checks the next person's purchases into that side. It's not so drastically different from how we do things here, but I believe they are much more aware of how many bags they use.  Embed Quote"

Unknown is how many households now are buying plastic bags to replace the ones not used by the shopping stores.  Embed Quote"

It's hard to know how many to take in.  Maybe a new design would solve these problems.  Bottom line:  Over the last six months I've seen fewer and fewer people in the checkout line with cloth bags.  Also, in Austin, TX, where my mother-in-law lives, the city council has outlawed the plastic bags.  So, people have to buy plastic garbage bags since the garbage pick up companies want everything packaged inside the garbage cans.Edit - One more re-use of the bags:  A friend has a mail order business. In these difficult economic times he is able to save money by using the bags as fill in boxes he ships, rather than spend money on Styrofoam ""peanuts.""  I haven't seen an analysis but I think Styrofoam might be worse for the environment.  Embed Quote"

People are Self centered People tend to be self centered and infact there is nothing wrong about it. Plastics are cheap, comfortable, durable and ubiquitous, making them best fit for everyday use. Plastic has become vital like electricity for majority. Ban to such a product obviously won't be favored by majority.  2. No proper substitutes There is no proper substitues for plastic bags that are equally good, cheap, comfortable and durable. Paper bags could be a substitute but it's niether environment friendly nor comfortable nor durable. Paper production requires hundreds of thousands of gallons of water as well as toxic chemicals like sulphurous acid, which can lead to acid rain and water pollution. Jute bags could be comfortable and durable but not cheap. Hence there is no effective substitute for plastic bags as of now. 3. Less awareness about impacts and environmental degradation plastic causesMost people are not aware about the impacts of plastic and the amount of environmental degradation that plastics have caused.Plastic causes serious damage to environment both during its production and disposal. It is a non-biodegradable material composed of toxic chemicals it pollutes not only ecosystems but human health. If plastic get into the environment it is a hazard to all life living in the water environment and land. Fish, birds, marine mammals, reptiles, and other animals can become entangled in discarded plastics and sustain injuries from ingesting plastics. Thus they don't find sufficient reasons to ban plastics from their perception.4. Lack of knowledge on the scales of consumption Most people are driven by thought that 'I use just 1 or 2 plastic bags per day, how can that be a threat to environment?' howerver the scale of consumption is beyond their perceptionPlastic bags in USA alone [1] Approx. 380 billion plastic bags are used in the United States every year. That’s more than 1,200 bags per US resident, per year.Approx. 100 billion of the 380 billion are plastic shopping bags.An estimated 12 million barrels of oil is required to make that many plastic bags.Only 1 to 2% of plastic bags in the USA end up getting recycled.Thousands of marine animals and more than 1 million birds die each year as a result of plastic pollution.The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that there are 46,000 pieces of plastic litter floating in every square mile of ocean.Plastic bags are often mistakenly ingested by animals, clogging their intestines which results in death by starvation. Other animals or birds become entangled in plastic bags and drown or can’t fly as a result.Even when they photo-degrade in landfill, the plastic from single-use bags never goes away, and toxic particles can enter the food chain when they are ingested by unsuspecting animals.Greenpeace says that at least 267 marine species are known to have suffered from getting entangled in or ingesting marine debris. Nearly 90% of that debris is plastic.Americans consume more than 10 billion paper bags per year. Approximately 14 million trees are cut down every year for paper bag production.Possible alternates to plastic banI suggest plastics can be dealt by government the way they deal with tobacco products like cigarette. Increased taxation Making it mandatory to include Warning message: 'Avoid plastics, it degrades our beautiful environment'  to each plastic bagFine civilians for improper disposal of plastics Banning plastic in reserved areas for tourism, wildlife and bird sanctuaries Support jute products, reduce taxes for jute companiesSource: [1] Dangers of plastic bags  Embed Quote"

Washington DC and Montgomery County (Maryland) have both enacted these policies after SF did showed that it could work. I saw people buying 100 dollars worth of groceries refuse to pay 20 cents for bags to carry them to their car and just insisted on putting their food back into their cart and transporting it out loosely. People will go crazy to save just that little bit of money if they can.Plastic bags are also extremely cheap to make and since they are bad for the environment there should be a tax on their consumption (like taxing cigarettes) to counteract the strain they put on our environment so make them expensive enough to where the price outweighs the convenience and no more plastic bags.  Embed Quote"

Many folks re-use them to transport items at a later date and a large number of people use them as trash bags. I support banning of plastic bags though not much thought is paid to trash can liners which are made of much heavier material and are used in most households; each household with multiple trash cans. This adds up to a massive amount of these bags in landfills and this is one of the reasons I came up with a patent-pending easy clean bagless trash can.

If 'bring your own bag' was enforced everywhere, we will automatically begin to manufacture, sell and buy non-disposable bags.It is a bit like wanting all kinds of produce at all times of the year. Once you know it can be done, counter-arguments, such as how your lettuce and beans are driven in (or even flown in some cases) don't work. Oranges in the New England winter? F' Yeah! I can walk into a store empty handed whenever I want and buy a week's worth of stuff? Of course.People want to care about the environment, but only after their own comforts are secured.  In this direction, sustainability initiatives are almost always PR stunts. What can be said in the case of Plastic vs. Paper can be said about Hybrids vs. regular cars too in terms of overall environmental impact. It is true, as many have mentioned here, that paper vs. plastic is a trade off. Any kind of disposable bags constitute a huge mass in the supply+disposal chain, which takes money and oil to run.

So why foul the nest?,"I find the rapid spread of auto ownership to be a lamentable trend (living as I do in an increasingly smoggy and gridlocked Beijing), but I think I understand the mentality behind it. For a while there was official resistance to it: licensing was prohibitively expensive, not to mention the exorbitant tariffs on imported automobiles (at a time with the domestic Chinese auto industry was negligible). Domestic consumer desire was, as far as I can tell, what drove the development of the industry--not. as with many other industries, the lure of export markets. So we need to look at why so many ordinary Chinese citizens found car culture so alluring.One simple reason is that American culture--America has never been shy about promoting its way of life--has for so long so venerated the automobile. So much of our pop culture, from rock and hip hop songs to Hollywood movies, pushes it out there. It's a symbol of individualism, an expression of the self, the ultimate consumer item and it's so celebrated in our culture. Why wouldn't Chinese aspire to it?Because it's environmentally irresponsible, of course. That sounds reasonable enough to recent American converts to environmentalism. Of course many of them have owned a car and been driving since their mid teens. Chinese tend to bristle at this and find it insufferably patronizing. You've had your turn at the trough now for a hundred years, guzzling down fossil fuels and putting more carbon in the air, cumulatively, than China has by many multiples. Now it's China's turn, the thinking goes. It's shortsighted and entirely regrettable, of course, but part of me can be empathetic. Chinese friends of mine have described the feeling like this: China arrives late, still hungry and still skinny as a rail, and takes its seat at a banquet already long in progress. Sitting around the table are corpulent and morbidly obese Western countries, who immediately browbeat the new arrival as he reaches for the prime rib, regaling him with woeful tales of their gout, their diabetes, their fatty livers, their clogged arteries--all the result of a lifetime of overindulgence.

So why foul the nest?,"For the government of China, automobiles are second only to electrification as a massive driver of industrial and economic development. The auto industry will also be largely a domestic industry, with a good size export factor.  What can substitute for a large auto industry? I can't think of anything, even massive military production. The rest of the world is already pushing back at exports from China - so a massive growth in exports is not an option,Are automobiles an appropriate technology for China ? China is still 57% rural.  http://www.landingchina.com/chin...If we look at this map, we will see there are some big high density areas (red and dark orange) - but there are also huge areas with population densities lower than most US suburbs - the light orange and the medium orange.There is also extensive rural poverty.  To end this poverty cars will be needed to so people in rural areas can get to rural cities to work, and buy and sell farm products - just like in the Midwestern US and the Great Plains states.  That is a model that has been shown to work.So the answer is yes, not only are cars (& trucks) appropriate, not only the best solution for rural areas, but in many cases the only solution.  Bullet trains aren't going to be built in the sticks (only California is stupid enough to do that)China is not just giant cities like Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing.Environmental impacts  will be much less than expected. First, every car built today gets recycled, and has a high recycled metal content. So once the fleet is built, metal consumption drops.Electricity will provide most of the power, not gasoline.Natural gas from shale will supply much of the energy for transport.The cars will have pollution controls, and get high mileage.How many cars and trucks will be needed? Much less than we would think.  Look at the demographics of China in the age pyramid -http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dem...Notice how sharp narrowing of the number of young people, primarily due to the one child policy. Using the US numbers for 1960 of 180 million people and 75 million cars, I would take a SWAG and say that a fleet of ~ 300 million would work for 2025, for a rural population of about 600 million. That's around 15 million a year, current production is about 13 million per year, with 1 million exports.I think a Chinese car culture would be cool. The potential for incredible road trips - on new, smooth highways - would be great.  I think I would be great if Chinese young people could use a car to get out of their parents house's and drive somewhere to go makeout.If China, with 5000 years of civilization, chooses to copy what the US is doing, that is very flattering, and it is really bad form to discourage this.I like Kaiser's banquet analogy.As for the US lecturing China on economic development, that's about as stupid as Calpers requesting changes in the way Steve Jobs runs Apple. It is amazing to me that the PRC financial ministries have only told the US to STFU a few times.  Embed Quote"

So why foul the nest?,"One problem that China faces that factors into this new car culture is necessity. In many ways the dramatic turnaround in the US economy at the end of WWII and the increase of discharged GI's entering the civilian workforce drove a construction boom that centered around development of suburban areas. This was possible because of the wide availability of automobiles and their relative affordability. In China this development has occured backwards to that of the States. Local governments, in order to meet their budgetary requirements, rely on the sale of land use rights to fill their coffers.  This leads to massive urban sprawl and poor urban planning for many of the the newly minted 2nd and 3rd tier cities. This, in turn, spawns a demand for personal transportation that is not only serviced by the luxury segment but also affordable local automobiles, electric mopeds and three wheelers. This is perpetuated by cities mimicking urban design themes from Beijing that are intended to convey grandiosity and authority rather than practical urban planning for, what should be, a largely pedestrian population. If you head to many of these cities' new areas, they are often  vacant and soulless places intersected by four lane buleavards that lead to no where. So if you live in a mid-rise apartment far from the city center, some form of personal transportation is practically a necessity for your daily life.  Embed Quote"

So why foul the nest?,"It hasn't.China is spending a ton of money on Public Transport, and infrastructure. You can get by in most major cities without a car if you just have a motor scooter.The thing though is that China is big, so as China is doing everything it can to avoid the some sort of car culture in the United States, you end up with massive amounts of people on the road, simply because you have a billion people. The per capita car ownership rate in China is low, but anything times a billion means traffic jams.Also, there are some paradoxes and ironies. Chinese government policy in general tries to make it very difficult to own a car. There is a wait list for car registration and license plates, and there are taxes and large expenses associated with a car. The paradox is that because it is so difficult to own a car, it becomes a huge status symbol, because having a car means that you are either rich or politically connected, and so every upwardly mobile middle class family wants a car so that they can show it off to their neighbors.  Embed Quote"

I think cars have always appealed as status symbols and the Chinese, like everyone else, are creatures of vanity. That, for starters, is what I'd offer as an explanation for the demand side. For the supply side, I believe the automotive industry (manufacturing) is a good source of employment for China's population. I'm speaking broadly here, but I don't think it is difficult to understand China following both Japan and South Korea's footsteps in using auto manufacturing as a key step in their economic development. The pollution, congestion, and sprawl that results have therefore been decided to be acceptable costs and, in some cases, even desirable (it suggests things are a happenin'!)I'm going to cut it short here and 1) hope Kaiser Kuo provides a better answer since I see him currently answering as well, and 2) consider editing my answer for more later.

In fact the public transit is getting much more funding from government and which is very sophisticated in certain regions such as Beijing, Yangtze Delta (Part of Jiangsu, Shanghai & Zhejiang), and Pearl River Delta. Airports, high-speed rail, high-way shuttle, subway, light-rail, local bus are all connected. High-speed train connecting from Beijing and Shanghai will start to operate in 6 months. It will only take 4 hours for the 1000Km trip. Who will bother to take the flight?Many other cities (usually province capitals) are duplicating this model to build their own metro-transportation system in addition to freeways for cars.Home cars offers biggest mobility, but public transit still offers the biggest value of transportation.  Embed Quote"

China recognizes this and would like to drive it's economy also. The car is the icon of materialism. Many Chinese would like to have a piece of the same opulence that North Americans have enjoyed for decades. Unfortunately, the quick expansion of the automotive (and other) industries in China has also caused some environmental issues which have not been checked as in North America. Many of the issues China is seeing today are a mirror image of the same issues in North America many decades ago. Although China has it's own manufacturers, many of the North American Companies also have a large presence in China. A higher standard of living in North America has also brought about higher costs of manufacturing. In an attempt to lower costs, North American manufacturers now have very large facilities in China. This has been a huge economic benefit to the Chinese at the expense of the North Americans. Not to mention, China is benefiting from huge strides in emissions control, quality and safety that North American vehicle manufacturers have built into their cars over the decades. This type of technology can ultimately help China as they bring control to their industrialization.  Embed Quote"

However, it should be noted that ""natural"" mercury emissions are accounted as including re-emission of both anthropogenic and ""natural"" deposits, and that re-emission of previously anthropogenically-attributable mercury has been estimated to account for 50% of all ""natural"" land and ocean emissions into the atmosphere (Lindberg et al. 2007, pg. 20). So, mercury vapor entering the atmosphere from an open field would be counted as a ""natural"" emission, even if that mercury had been deposited in that field as a result of a nearby coal-fired power plant.Mercury cycles through the environment, so the question of where the mercury found in fish comes from depends on how many steps back you go. The short version is that mercury in fish comes from what they eat, including plants, crustaceans, and other fish. Mercury bioaccumulates up the food chain, which is why top predatory fish have higher concentrations than those at the bottom of the food chain. The mercury bioaccumulating up the food chain (and the one of major concern to human health) is methylmercury (MeHg), which has been converted from inorganic mercury by bacteria living at the sedimentary level. This methylmercury is then taken up by the marine food web, and also explains why bottom-dwelling animals tend to have higher mercury concentrations than you would otherwise expect.The mercury in sediment has settled from the water. Mercury enters the water from atmospheric and terrestrial deposition. There is run-off from surface deposits, direct dumping, settling of mercury-laden atmospheric particulates, mercury-laden rain, etc. A 2002 paper by Mason and Shau (see bottom of comment reference) estimated that atmospheric deposition into the oceans accounted for around 15.4 times that of surface deposition.According to a 2010 estimate by Pirrone et al., annual ""natural"" emissions to the atmosphere (including re-emission of anthropogenic emissions) totalled 5207 megagrams (5,207,000 kilograms), while annual anthropogenic emissions totalled 2320 megagrams (2,320,000 kilograms). The study found that ""fossil-fuel fired power plants, ferrous and non-ferrous metals manufacturing facilities, caustic soda production plants, ore processing facilities, incinerators for urban, medical and industrial wastes, cement plants and chemicals production facilities"" released significant amounts of mercury into the atmosphere, and that ""fossil fuel-fired power plants are the largest point sources of mercury released to the atmosphere"" (Pirrone et al. 2010, pg. 4726). It's also important to note that mercury concentrations are higher near their source, so fish living in an area close to coal-fired power plants are likely to have higher concentrations than those that are not. Deposits in sediment and elsewhere may also endure for a long time, so closure of a plant or other point source may not reduce risk for years or decades. My doctoral thesis, Fish Consumption, Mercury Intake, and the Associated Risks to the Kuwaiti Population, considers the past presence of a nearby chlorine and bleach processing plant that had used mercury cathodes as a possible contributor to mercury concentrations in fish in the Arabian Gulf, though the plant closed in the 1970s.I'll have a look for historical databases on mercury concentrations in fish and let you know if something comes up.

I'm pretty blase about it generally speaking. I know people who monitor the AQI with apps on their phones, but I don't pay it much attention. Whenever they comment on it I just shrug my shoulders and get on with things. However, Friday was something else. You know the pollution is bad when even I start talking about it and adapting my behaviour to avoid it. Usually I walk home from my nearest subway stop (about 20-25 minutes) but I took the bus this time; I didn't want to spend any meaningful time outside. I also picked up a mask on my way home (though one much less impressive than Andy Lee's) and when I got home I kept all my windows closed (I often have them open a little to air the apartment). The smog was overwhelming. Visibility was down to a hundred yards and you could taste the dust, not just in your mouth but all the way back in your throat, and it was still there the next morning. I've drunk a lot of water this weekend. It's not been pleasant.But, as I say, it's a fact of life. The cloud will move on and things will get back to normal quickly, which is to say, they will return to the normal levels of tolerable pollution. I'm also glad the Shanghai Marathon took place last weekend and not this week. They would surely have had to cancel it if it were otherwise.  Embed Quote"

I've been rather jaded about air pollution until it reached meteoric levels last week. I was waiting for the Blade Runne Blimp to silently swoop in through the haze advertising Pan Am and Koss headsets. Now I'm looking at dropping serious cash for a clean room strength air purifier for the home and the office while considering if an off-world colony is right for me. What concerns me is the short-term solution, at least in Shanghai, is to lower the benchmark for alerts during the WInter( Shanghai just lowered its air quality benchmark because that's how bad it is), which is a stark reminder that China still deploys such brazenly self-serving tactics. From what I have read, there is no long-term solution to the problem and it is likely to get worse before it gets any better.  Embed Quote"

Beijing's air quality is always in the news and it is probably a lot worse, but Shanghai's AQI has been consistently >100 since October. While 100 is not as bad as 500, I feel like this ""it could be worse"" mentality is quite unhealthy (literally). While I'm not getting on the next plane back home, it's definitely something I'm going to take into consideration when it comes to deciding whether I will stay in the longer term. People don't realize how serious the adverse health effects of air pollution are because it's not readily apparent. Beijing's lung cancer has gone up 60% in a decade despite the % of smokers remaining flat, and I wouldn't want to become part of that statistic for Shanghai in another 10 years. In the meantime, I'm stocking up on PM2.5 masks (they were completely sold out last week) and hoping I don't see another 500+ day anytime soon!  Embed Quote"

I have contemplated relocating to one of the larger cities, but the air pollution is one of the main factors keeping me away (I also just don't enjoy the fast-paced lifestyle of the bigger cities like some people do). I have lived in Kunming, a city in Southwestern China famous for its ""clean air"". Indeed, Kunming regularly enjoys air significantly better than its big city eastern counterparts. However, even Kunming's air has been getting worse, due to increased automobile use and lots of construction. This is one reason why I am moving to Dali, a small town in western Yunnan Province where the air is several times better than that in Kunming, and several hundred times better than that in Beijing or Zhengzhou.  Embed Quote"

This is one sentence from their free online book on global warming:http://books.nap.edu/openbook.ph...The Economist, a top-notch business magazine with a strong free-enterprise ideology, would also need to be part of the conspiracy.  They have a special issue on what should be done to stop human-caused global warming:http://www.economist.com/node/14...The Chinese government would also need to be part of the conspiracy.  As the Economist report points out:UNLIKE America’s  leaders, China’s bosses are not much troubled by recalcitrant legislatures.  The government  has therefore had no difficulty in executing a smart volte face [turnaround] on climate change.  Around three years ago its fierce resistance to  the notion of  any limit on its greenhouse gas emissions  started  to  soften.  It now seems to be making serious  efforts to control them.One reason for this change is  the country’s growing awareness of its vulnerability to a warming world.  The  monsoon seems to be weakening, travelling less far inland and dumping its rainfall on the coasts. As a result China is seeing floods in the southeast and droughts in the northwest.  At the same time the country’s leaders are deeply concerned about the melting of the glaciers on the Tibetan plateau, which feed not just the Ganges, the  Indus, the Brahmaputra and the Mekong but also the Yangzi and Yellow rivers (see map). And so on - I could go on for hours.  If global warming is a hoax, it's the world's biggest hoax.  Embed Quote"

Many places will get hotter, but many will also get colder. Global temperatures will rise as a result though, because there will be more places getting hotter than there will be places getting cooler. This is why 'climate change' is a better phrase to use than 'global warming'.It's also a bit of a misconception to think that all climate change is anthropogenic.

History is full of them.  Lets just try and keep the debate civil and recognize some fundamental laws that can help us with a very complex problem.  Embed Quote"

If so, I've written several articles about this issue.  The SAD (Standard American Diet) is one of the worst in the world, and we are exporting it to other countries!  That diet is high in processed/junk/fast foods, high in refined carbs, salt, fats (especially veggie oils from frying), preservatives, and chemicals, now in the thousands. Many are not disclosed on food labeling.  This diet helps to spike blood glucose and inflammation, both are detrimental to health and arteries.  Plus, those foods lack quality nutrients or balance (vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants). In fact, those processed carbs like wheat and sugar take vitamins and minerals from other areas to complete digestion, creating a deficit. It's been known for several years that the worst LDL particles (small, dense ones), are driven by wheat and sugar, not cholesterol or saturated fats!  In addition, refined veggie oils (high in omega-6) can quickly oxidize in the body, which also triggers arterial inflammation. The only oil I recommend is EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) because it has a set of unique antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. It's great for salads or dressing veggies but frying will destroy the delicate antioxidants.  Smoking, inactivity, stress and a lack of sleep also add to weight, inflammation and compromise immune function. Taken together, we have the perfect storm of a bad diet and other habits which contribute to weight gain, hypertension, diabetes, systemic inflammation and athero! It's so bad, they are finding early athero in young people in their teens and 20s!  Here's are some links for more info and source material: 3 Shocking Myths About Heart Disease http://www.sott.net/article/2425...  Embed Quote"

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I did my Masters in International Health which was public health with a focus on developing countries. I also did this in Australia, so I'm not sure how helpful my answer is going to be but I'll give it a shot for the A2A. I realised I wanted to do International Public Health after a brief stint volunteering in a community based cataract screening and surgery project in Orissa, India. I had previously completed a Bachelor Degree in Human Biology and was in a soul destroying job in a pharmaceutical company, the sole purpose of which was to fund my then expensive taste in clothing (I'm writing this in an man's second hand shirt) and weird obsession with fake nails (ew, gross I know) - things have changed. I went to India not because I had any particular interest in India (now I love it and a little piece of my soul will always reside there) but because I had a crappy day at work and a volunteer thing popped up on my screen and my 21st birthday was coming up and my parents said that I could go on a trip instead of having a party if I wanted. And I applied. I was blown away. First by just how awesome India was, my little slice of Orissa was like a little slice of heaven. But then about the health issues people were facing. What I took issue with though was not the clinical aspect. I wasn't say, super interested in being able to treat a specific child for a specific problem. As a cultural outsider who did not speak the language I really didn't see that as my role. But I was interested in issues of access and equity and resource distribution and epidemiology and initiatves that changed the health of entire communities, of prevention. Rather than returning to the bowels of the pharma industry I thought it better to get the skills I was going to need in my new area of passion. But I also needed experience. So I studied my Masters of International Health at Curtin University (which is in Western Australia) by distance while I worked at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) on a child health project overseen by the WHO. The Australian government pays for my education. They also paid me to work in Bangladesh for that year. Sweet deal huh? The organisation helped me to conduct my Masters dissertation research which was on the care-seeking behaviours of mothers in the first three days after their baby was born in an area where we were running a Village Health Worker project. I loved it. I worked for that organisation for another year, then moved to South Sudan where I worked on am HIV and Gender Based Violence Project for returning refugees. My Masters helped me get my foot in those doors but a key component was contacts. You really would struggle to get anywhere in development work without contacts and I had been getting progressively better at putting myself out there to make them (self-promotion is an uncomfortable thing for an Australian).l then decided that aside from the skills I got from the Masters I needed other skills. I felt strange telling people how things should be done without any knowledge of how one would do them on the ground. I decided to get my training in nursing and midwifery because of that (I did not have the time nor the patience for a med degree!). And as I suspected, reading an article on how to stop post-partum haemorrhage is significantly different from actually trying to stop someone from haemorrhaging.  The break to do this study wasn't all advantages though. I am only now re-enetering public health development work and am doing it at an entry level (HIV and Tuberculosis Public Health Officer in Botswana).  My only tip with a Masters degree is that it isn't about the degree. Reading a bunch of papers to write your own paper should not be the point and will get you no-where. You have to make connections. Which means you have to network. Which means that you attend every event/lecture/afternoon tea that has even the remotest connection to the field you are interested in. And then you go an ask people a whole bunch of questions and see if they need an RA. And you seek out volunteer work and internships. Make the degree work for you.  P.S. If you haven't already its time to develop an intellectual crush on Hans Rosling and Paul Farmer. Enjoy!  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I earned my MPH in 2001 from UC Berkeley. My background was as a biology undergraduate who had spent 3 years doing bench science molecular biology research. As much as this was a wonderful experience (at UCSF and University of Washington), I was interested in population level determinants of disease so pursued an MPH. An MPH by definition is quite broad in its requirements and emphasis, and it is incumbent on the individual to pursue their own nitch. That having been said, I think it is important not to delay pursuing an MPH because you are not sure of you own specific interest. I went in to an MPH with an interest in infectious diseases, and within the first year found a new focus in social determinants of health. My main point here is to not close yourself off to possible interests that you may not know about prior to enrollment - exposure to a variety of areas of practice and research is fundamental to most MPH programs.An advantage of doing an MPH is the flexibility to purse either an applied or research career based on the degree. In addition to switching from an interest in infectious disease to social determinants of health, I also switched from wanting an applied career in public health to being interested in research. If interested in research, of course, it is essential to pursue a doctorate following the MPH. The good news about PhDs in public health is there is much better funding and you generally don't have to take many loans.My concentration was Epidemiology/Biostatistics, which was great. It was essentially a focus on a methodological toolkit that could be applied to various problems. I generally am of the view that subject specific content can more easily be pursued on ones own, and the more technical content of epidemiology and biostatistics is more easily aquired in the formal academic setting (although of course this can be learned through self-study as well if you have the inclination). I wasn't that enthralled by calculus in undergrad, but applied statistics is a whole other thing - I became totally enthralled.The MPH is a big money maker for schools of public health, so there are few opportunities for funding. The best bet is to get a position as a research assistant that will pay for living expenses and depending on the institution, some coverage of tuition. I'm now an Assistant Professor and hire research assistants for 10-20 hour a week positions that pay about $15/hour but also cover a portion of tuition. You will put yourself in the best position for these positions if you have some programming experience in R or SAS or Stata, but there are a variety of positions that are available. Look for postings for positions at Schools of Public Health that you are interested in applying to, or contact Professors doing research in areas that you are interested in. In addition to helping to fund an MPH, working with a research group is invaluable in learning how Public Health research is done. For me, earning an MPH allowed me to have a switch in my career trajectory, and begin to acquire a statistical analytic toolkit, as well as understand theories of disease causation, which were invaluable to me being able to pursue work that was most aligned with my interests. The curriculum is somewhat of a remarkable balance of intellectual and practical application to improving health. If that suits you, you should pursue it. As I once overheard a physician say, if you really want to help people - don't become a physician - study public health.After getting my MPH, I ended up going on to get my doctorate in public health at Harvard, and am now an Assistant Professor at Stanford. So this is a fairly traditional very academic track. But my colleagues in my MPH program have done a number of diverse pursuits, and in almost all cases have found very fulfilling work, ranging from working at Indian Health Services, to medical school to research assistants to environmental advocates.  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I decided to get an MPH while I was serving in the Peace Corps as a community health volunteer in Peru. I had a bachelor of journalism with little (ok, no) background in science. But my skills in communication seemed to translate pretty well to health education, as I could quickly research topics I knew little about and then translate the information into something that was easy to understand. I spent two years working with community health workers and teen promoters on the prevention of HIV, diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, dengue, malaria... I loved it. So when I was getting ready to go back to the States, I looked at the different MPH programs around the country. Many are more research-based, but given my background, I wanted more of a practical focus. In the end I applied and went to Tulane University in New Orleans for their health education and communication program. About halfway through my studies, I discovered I had a strong interest in epidemiology (in a nutshell: the study of how diseases appear and move through populations). My advisor encouraged me to explore other departments, and I ended up taking about as many courses related to epidemiology as I did in health education. I was fascinated and found I was most comfortable when I worked with the two concentrations in combination. My experience was enriched a lot by being in New Orleans. It's a wonderful but in some ways still-struggling city, where many of the public health concerns I learned about in the classroom were right there in my neighborhood. Instead of a research thesis, we were required to complete 300 hours of practicum. I did mine at the New Orleans Health Department and also volunteered at a safety-net clinic. Being a part of the health community there not only complemented my studies, but also helped confirm that I was in the right field. So that's the good stuff. The financing was the hard part. My program was expensive, with very few opportunities for scholarships or grants. I and most of my friends financed our education with student loans. For me it was worth it. Even after graduating, I'm still fascinated by current  research and bore (or sometimes horrify) my husband and friends with health-related trivia. Studying public health made me healthier. More in tune with what's going on in our world and more knowledgable about how policy and environments can affect how healthy we are. But that's me. I'd be interested to see how my experience differed from others here on Quora.  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I received my MPH in 2006 with a concentration in environmental public health. I was teaching environmental science in high school at the time and my thought was that the degree would improve my teaching but would also give me additional opportunities outside of teaching and would give me the skill set I need to have a positive impact on the environment.I found that the degree on its own didn't have a lot of teeth; I read a lot of books and wrote a lot of papers but I didn't come out of the program with any tangible skill set. If I had focused on biostats it would have been a different story but the environmental concentration gave me the opportunity to do environmental compliance work.It turned out I hated that work; it's basically writing reports showing that your company isn't doing anything wrong. It's a lot of ""I"" dotting and ""T"" crossing.  Most of the jobs that I have seen for environmental related work tend to veer towards government/industrial environmental compliance - other environmental jobs seem to require a background in environmental engineering or industrial ecology.If I had complimented my MPH with another degree, like a masters in environmental engineering or law then maybe I could have had greater opportunities within the environmental field - I am currently looking into a data analytical program to compliment my knowledge with learning to use large data sets for urban sustainability.My caution for anyone interested in an MPH is simple; on its own it probably won't expand you into a ton of opportunities - use it to improve your quantitative skills or complement it with another degree to really stand out.  Embed Quote"

There are no residential uses, and no agricultural uses that could result in exposure to maneb in residential settings(from http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs...)Bolded part is wrongSee this study (journal article is linked): http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele...That epidemiological study didn't examine farmers who constantly work with pesticides but people who simply lived near where farm fields were sprayed with the fungicide maneb and the herbicide paraquat. It found that the risk for Parkinson's disease for these people increased by 75 percent.Now a follow-up study adds two new twists. Once again the researchers returned to California's fertile Central Valley, and for the first time have implicated a third pesticide, ziram, in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. Second, instead of looking just at whether people lived near fields that were sprayed, they looked at where people worked, including teachers, firefighters and clerks who worked near, but not in, the fields.Also, atrazine (which is a triazine herbicide)In 2006 the EPA concluded that the triazine herbicides posed ""no harm that would result to the general U.S. population, infants, children or other... consumers.""[4]Yet...Some studies suggest that even the concentrations meeting U.S. federal standards may be dangerous, with implications for human birth defects, low birth weights and menstrual problems.[1] Findings from further studies released in early 2010 have tended to support the conclusion that even low doses can increase health risks, leading to calls for further testing and renewed EPA evaluation of atrazine's safety.[21]In August 2009, Atrazine was prominently featured in the New York Times as a potential cause of birth defects, low birth weights and menstrual problems when consumed at concentrations below federal standards.[1] A Natural Resources Defense Council's Report on Atrazine suggested that the EPA is ignoring atrazine contamination in surface and drinking water in the central United States.[22]===Also, the September 11 aftermathSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chr...Whitman appeared twice in New York City after the September 11 attacks to inform New Yorkers that the toxins released by the attacks posed no threat to their health.[27] On September 18, the EPA released a report in which Whitman said, ""Given the scope of the tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington, D.C. that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink."" She also said, ""The concentrations are such that they don't pose a health hazard...We're going to make sure everybody is safe.""[28] Later, a 2003 report by the EPA's inspector general determined that such assurances were misleading, because the EPA ""did not have sufficient data and analyses"" to justify the assertions when they were made.[29]A report in July 2003 from the EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response gave extensive documentation supporting many of the inspector general's conclusions, and carried some of them still further.[30] Further, the report found that the White House had ""convinced EPA to add reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones"" by having the National Security Council control EPA communications after the September 11 attacks.[31] And the result of that? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hea...An ongoing Pennsylvania State University/Monmouth University study reported that respiratory illnesses grew by more than two hundred percent in the year and a half after the September 11 attacks. (This was the first study that monitored police officers at the Ground Zero site. It was published in the ""Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine."") In this study of 471 police officers, 19 percent of the officers in October 2001 experienced shortness of breath; 44 percent of the officers experienced shortness of breath in April 2003. The percentage of the 471 officers coughing upphlegm increased from 14 percent in October 2001 to 31 percent in 2003.[20]A 2006 medical study of fire fighters reported that those personnel who inhaled Ground Zero air essentially lost 12 years of lung function.[20] Additionally, a Mount Sinai report found that 70 percent of recovery and rescue workers reported an increase in debilitated respiratory function between 2002 and 2004.[20][21]A 2008 report by New York City's Department of Health indicated that up to 70,000 people might have long term health problems due to the dust. The findings were the result of the city's health registry of September 11 first responders, residents, and others.[22]  Embed QuoteAnswered in one minute."

If you're dealing with rodent fleas, you would be wise to exclude the rodents from your home, but you'd also likely have to take measures to kill the fleas as well. Whereas most methods for flea elimination depend upon pesticides used in the environment or on the host, one can also reduce flea populations - at least to some extent - by vacuuming, trapping, by application of heat, and perhaps by other means. Habitat modification is another method. So, paving your yard should be expected to make it difficult for fleas to survive there, but this would seem an impractical method. Indoors, removing carpets and upholstered furniture can make it far easier to eliminate fleas by cleaning.  Embed Quote"

Chen's answer to Is organic food better for you? for details","Apparently nothttp://blog.al.com/frugalmom/200...A total of twenty-eight harvests were made including sixteen of lettuce, four of strawberry, four of tomatoes, and four control lettuce batches. Each batch was divided into seven treatment groups. One group was analyzed in an unrinsed state as received from the field; one group was rinsed under tap water for one minute. The five remaining groups were individually treated with either FIT®, Fruit & Vegetable Wash Organiclean, Vegi-Clean, or a 1% solution of Palmolive® and then rinsed under tap water for one minute. In the case of the control lettuce batches all seven-treatment groups were processed in an unrinsed state to ensure that each group contained statistically equivalent pesticide residue levels.A total of 196 samples were processed. Detailed statistical analysis showed that in all cases at least one group was different from the rest. Pairwise comparison showed that the group that was different was the unrinsed produce. There is little or no difference between tap water rinsing or using a fruit and vegetable wash in reducing residues of the nine pesticides studied. The removal of waxes and/or dirt from the produce was not examined as part of this study.If you did not take the time to read all of the mumbo-jumbo written above, here is the quick answer: there was NO difference in the levels of pesticide found on the produce! It did not matter if you washed it with any of the special washes or with watered down soap: they had the same effect as washing with plain old tap water for one minute.Also, some pesticides, particularly neonicotinoid pesticides, are systemic pesticides that are present throughout the entire plant. See examples belowImidacloprid can be applied to many vegetables (including tomatoes and leafy greens) right up to the day they’re harvested.Thiamethoxam was first approved as a seed treatment for corn in 2002, and thiamethoxam products that are applied to the soil have since been approved for use on most vegetable and fruit crops. See a photo of seed corn treated with this chemical.Clothianidin is used as a seed treatment on canola, cereals, corn and sugar beets, and as a soil treatment for potatoes.Dinotefuran can be applied to soil or sprayed on leafy greens, potatoes and cucumber family crops.Read more: http://www.motherearthnews.com/o...

We are moving everything, even heavy furniture, to make sure we vacuum everywhere. I have been told that you need to vacuum as much as you can every day until they're gone. We've been vacuuming for hours over the past two evenings, and we're still not done with the first pass. (We have a 6 month old baby and a 3 year old occupying most of our non-work time, so the house hasn't had a thorough cleaning in awhile.)Washing: For now, we're doing all curtains, all bedding, any clothing that has come in contact with our sofa or floors since the outbreak started, plus any clothes in drawers where the aforementioned clothes were put away.  (Luckily, I had only done that with our baby--we had to wash all his clothes.)  We're also washing all fabric stuffed animals and toys. Water kills fleas, so washing does the job. (In comparison, I've read that with bed bugs the water has to be boiling hot to kill them.)Freezing: We're freezing all the fabric stuff that can't be washed, such as fabric toys that have batteries or sound, plus a bunch of canvas bins where we keep toys.Traps: We just bought the Ultimate Flea Traps that Justin Emig suggested in his answer.  We put a few of them out a few hours ago and there are a couple of fleas in them. The best results are achieved at night when the lights are out and there are no other light sources, so we'll have to see what they look like in the morning. (I'll try to update my answer when I'm not busy vacuuming/washing/freezing stuff.)Chemical Treatments:  As I mentioned, we have small children, so we don't want to use heavy pesticides in our extermination plan for our living space. Via the Berkeley Parents Network (found via a Google search), I found a number of parents that recommended a product (and company) called Flea Busters, which is a boric acid flea powder that is applied to carpets and baseboards. It says it is safe for kids and pets after it is applied. I ordered some from Amazon, and we;re planning to put it down this weekend.  We are also planning to fog (i.e. bomb) our unfinished basement where the kids spend absolutely no time.  We store a lot of stuff in our basement, so we're planning on cleaning everything that comes out of the basement after we fog it. (Also, we have natural gas, so we have to arrange for the gas to be turned off and on when we fog.)Treat the pets: Obviously, you can't eradicate fleas from your home if your pets are actively bringing them into your home. We actively put Frontline on our two cats ever month, but my husband thinks maybe he didn't do a good enough job of making sure it was on their skin last month when he applied it. Coincidentally, the cats had their annual vet appointment before the outbreak, so we found out about them first. The vet gave them pills to kill the adult fleas, then had us resume the Frontline to kill the eggs. We called the vet the other day to see if there was anything else we should do for them, and she said no.As a final note, having fleas is exhausting and it's a ton of work to get rid of them. At this point, I'm just glad it is not bed bugs.  If you found this question and my answer via a search engine search or a Quora search and you have an infestation, good luck. I'm with you because I'm currently there.Update 2/1/12: The above plan did work, but it took about 4-6 weeks for us to get rid of the fleas. We vacuumed almost every day for at least 4 weeks. We also bought the Flea Busters boric acid powder and applied that to our rugs and the hard floors. The first time, we didn't have enough for the hard wood floors, and it really seemed like after doing the rugs that it made absolutely no difference. We bought two more containers, and the following weekend we did all the crevices in the hard floors (including the cracks in between the hard wood boards and cracked between floor times), baseboards, and the rugs and furniture a second time. After that we just vacuumed like crazy, every night. It was exhausting.  We usually don't put flea stuff on the cats over the winter, but this year, we are. We are taking no chances, because we do not want to go through this again.Update 7/29/12: We made a big mistake this spring and gave the Kirkland brand spot flea control a try for a few months, and we were faced with another possible flea outbreak in June, with live fleas showing up on both our cats. After last summer, we chose the nuclear option (well, not quite nuclear, since we still won't bomb our whole house, but we did just about everything else). We took the cats to the vet ASAP for the pills the vet can give them that kills fleas. We bombed the basement, vacuumed the rest of the house thoroughly, and used the Flea Buster powder on all the rugs and upholstered furniture. We did not do any washing or vacuuming beyond this, and everything worked out o.k. Lesson learned about Costco's flea spot treatment! We switched back to Frontline.  Embed Quote"

Any natural means you can use to control fleas the better, however, if you have a serious infestation in your home and on your pet, you need to treat all cycles of the flea life cycle to have success.Bathing your pet with regular shampoo, but doing it more often can kill fleas on your pet. Washing your pet's bedding in hot water and steam cleaning carpet and furniture will give you the upper hand on flea larvae and eggs. Sprinkling diatomaceous earth on clean carpet will also kill flea eggs.

To determine risk, one must consider both the toxicity or hazard of the pesticide and the likelihood of exposure.

The pest company uses dinotefuran. Is it safe for humans after 4 hours like they claim? We have small children? Any suggestions on safer products?,"Is dinotefuran safe for humans? Safety is a relative term and the answer depends on the extent and route of exposure. This is true for all chemicals - including table salt and water.  If a pesticide has been selected wisely and applied in accordance to the label directions, then it very likely will offer far more benefit than risk to people and pets. You should ask the pest control company for a copy of the specimen label (the label on the package). That specifies how the product can be used (and by whom), and where/when it cannot be applied. Then, ask for the MSDS (material safety data sheet). These tend to be overly technical reviews that are akin to some of the nearly unreadable package inserts in medicines. They basically tell you almost every kind of possible adverse reaction that might happen, even if the risk is tiny.  The pest control company should happily hand you readable copies. Ideally, they would offer them to every customer, whether or not they asked. You can also find them online if you know the formulated product's brand name. If you really want to become overwhelmed with information, read the EPA's registration packet Page on EPA for this active ingredient.Are there 'safer' products? Perhaps. There are diverse products registered for use against fleas. Actually, I'd advise you to have a conversation first with your veterinarian. There are products that can be applied directly to the dog (some topical and some oral) that can be quite effective. Those work by killing the fleas that feed on the dog, or they cause the next generation of fleas not to mature (and hence, those won't ever blood feed). If you have many fleas that are free in the home environment, then it may make sense to have a treatment to your home. Whereas you can purchase some anti-flea products yourself, it usually is wisest to hire a competent licensed pest management professional. They should have the proper training and equipment to do it right.  Embed Quote"

Soak up, store and feed the above ground plant.  Carrots, potatoes, beets, onions, etc. always buy those as organic, above all others.  i've actually read about setback requirements for growing carrots next to roadways since they are thought to soak up and store the cadmium wash off from tires when it rains. The dirty dozen list is based on residue levels, meaning pesticides found on the outside of the fruit, and most can be washed off after buying.. thus I tend to take that lists recommendations lightly. What you want to avoid is systemic pesticides that move into and through the plant and into the flesh of the fruit - those cant be washed off or removed. And there's no way to know if a farmer used a systemic pesticide or not on any specific crop. Another reason to consider organic for all produce purchases.  Embed Quote"

There are however a lot of precautions in place to protect consumers from pesticide residue in place further up the supply chain.The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates pesticides. They determine a pesticide tolerance for each pesticide they approve. The pesticide tolerance is the amount of pesticide that can legally be found in food products. Both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) monitor and enforce the these pesticide tolerances. In 2012, the USDA tested 12,845 samples of fresh produce and other foods, and once again said that pesticide residues are not a safety issue. (Food Safety News, 2012).  Embed Quote"

Clothianidin, a type of neonicotinoid, has a half-life of four years. So this stuff is still going to be around in the soil at the end of the two year ban.Also, in the case of many species we don't really have figures for how many bees there were 50 years ago or how many bees there are now, so how will we know if numbers have increased when the ban ends?

The evidence that neonics are seriously damaging to honeybees is not particularly convincing when looking at the original scientific papers. It may very well be than new pesticides will be used that are more harmful to honey bees than neonics. It is also clear that there are many instances of CCD or extensive bee deaths that cannot be linked in any way to neonics. It is unlikely that an examination of the bee populations after the EU ban will help in determining the causes as there are too many factors that are influencing honey bee survival. What is really needed is very good field science not lab science which often doesn't translate well into the real world.One of the most comprehensive places on neonics science and analysis is the site of commercial beekeeper Randy Oliver.

They can also just as dangerous, and they can sometimes be much, much worse! It depends on the pesticide. ""Natural"" does not mean ""good"" or ""safe"" and ""synthetic"" does not mean ""bad."" You must consider each alternative independently.Firstly, if the natural and synthetic compound are identical chemicals, then they have the same safety. The origin does not matter in the slightest: distilled rainwater and water made from hyrolysis in a lab are both distilled water, botch chemically identical. The same for ""artificial"" and  ""natural"" colors and flavors in food. Often they are identical compounds.Second, if a pesticide left residue on your food that could harm you, it wouldn't be sold, else the farmer applied it wrong. Whether the pesticide was organic or not would not matter. Third, if the organic chemical is weaker, it will be applied in a higher dose and more frequently. That increases the risk of you consuming it.Last, several cases exist where organic pesticides are worse than synthetics. Here is an herbicide example, but I'm sure a pesticide pair exists for this. The synthetic herbicide Roundup leaves no residues and is harmless when eaten, but can cause eye irritation. The organic equivalent, that also leaves no residues and is equally effective as an herbicide, is Pharm Solutions Weed Pharm, made of 20% acetic acid (concentrated vinegar). It is corrosive, can cause permanent eye damage, causes skin sensitization, and is FATAL if swallowed or absorbed through the skin. What does that mean? For the farmer, it means they must use goggles and protective clothing when using the organic herbicide, but can use roundup naked if they so choose. As long as they follow the directions, they won't be harmed. As for the consumer, as neither compound leaves a residual, crops treated with either will be equally safe.Evidence shows that people who eat organic food have no health benefits compared to conventional agriculture food, and tend to get food poisioning a bit more. That's it.  If you are a grower, look at the labels on the pesticide and decide for yourself if it is toxic or not, but pay no heed to buzzwords like ""natural,"" ""organic,"" or ""synthetic"" that have no bearing on safety of efficacy, period.  Embed Quote"

I have a link to a great article on some myths about organic farming here. http://bites.ksu.edu/news/149506...Here is a little summary of that article. First let me say I support any form of agriculture that is sustainable, environmentally sound, and is safe. Organic food can, let me repeat that, can have many of the issues big ag does. There are ""organic"" pesticides that are more toxic than synthetic. Copper is used a lot, this has consequences for the environment. There have been recalls and food borne illness outbreaks associated with organic products. A lot of people make an automatic assumption that if they buy organic it is safer and better on all aspects. What needs to happen is for consumers to be more aware, question the seller. There is no reason to stop buying organic, we just can't buy it for the label. Buy because someone is proving to you they have a safer product, their livestock is kept/treated properly, they're willing to tell you what pesticides they use. Hell, they should be bragging about stuff like that and more they just need make it verifiable to the consumer.   Embed Quote"

It used to be banned by the government as it causes Parkinson's-like symptoms and DNA damage in the brain. They re-approved it as a natural/organic pesticide. And its use is not regulated. Organic farmers use it ad libitum (up to their own discretion).All organic produce are nutritionally equal in terms of vitamin profiles. However synthetically treated varieties are actually more nutritious in that they have a more favorable chemical profile. As in, organic produce is at a higher baseline toxicity (seeds are bred that way). Not only that, but when they are in danger (pests, crop harvest, etc) toxicity levels go up as the plants' only means of protection. Yes, this is the same in the other plants, but organics start out at that higher level, skyrocketing final readings.SO much so that synthetic plant carcinogen levels are measured at parts per billion, whereas organic plants are taken at a parts per thousand, or a parts per million level. That means that organics are on the magnitude of 1,000 to 1,000,000 times more toxic. I'm not even sure if that's before or after countless rotenone applications.Lastly, synthetic treatment for plants give them adequate protection so that they may have the safety reassurance of spending their time manufacturing healthy/beneficial chemicals. EVen with natural pesticides, organics are not fully protected and spend a lot of their valuable time making more self-defense toxins.  Embed Quote"

Roaches are attracted to filth, so clean up any leftovers, sweep up the crumbs, and check behind the fridge or in high cabinets for forgotten foodstuffs. Anything they can eat, keep away from them in a closed cupboard or fridge. Don't do what Joe from ""Joe's Apartment"" does, essentially. If you have no food for them, they should not come. If you do see roaches, feel free to kill them (or pick them up and toss them outside like I do... because I'm badass like that). Plenty of traps and sprays exist in most general stores, pick the one that seems best to you. A bait station where they take poison food back to their hideout is good. Herbal types are garbage: Roaches can survive nukes, do you really think they can't handle whatever your local food CoOp can throw at them? Poison them.Just be warned, especially for apartment people: if your nextdoor/upstairs/downstairs neighbor is messy and has a cockroach infestation, then no amount of cleaning will spare you. The roaches will probably wander into your place by accident despite your best efforts. Likewise, depending on what part of the planet you live in and how tightly sealed your house is from the great outdoors, you simply might not be able to make it bug proof. The key is to make the insects not want to stay, and cleanliness should do that. If all else fails, call your landlord or an exterminator. But save that for really nasty infestations. The truth is cockroaches are harmless; they don't bite, sting, or transmit diseases and actually spend 50% of their day cleaning themselves. Some people develop roach allergies with prolonged exposure, but otherwise the odd insect scurrying across the hall is not something to worry about. If they start singing and dancing on your toilet or following you to work à la ""Joe's Apartment,"" then you have a problem.  Embed QuoteVia  Eric Waters."

Roaches can smell the food, even little crumbs you might not see on the floor from very far away. If they will smell anything, they will come. If your neighbor has a messy house, or if you have a pet and you have to leave food the pet, roaches will come. Especially if the building you live in is an old building.I myself live in a 20-year old building and every year, as the weather gets warmer, roaches start to visit. I learned all these from experience;1. If you're gonna live in an apartment building, avoid living on the first floor. Roaches and all kinds of non-flying bugs first prefer the apartment that is closest to earth.2. Again, do NOT leave food outside and keep every food well-covered. Make sure your garbage bin is a closed one, and not leave any dishes outside. Either wash them after you finish using, or put them in the dishwasher.3. Fill every crack on the house/apartment's walls and on the floor. Roaches and other insects usually come out of walls. When you're not showering or using the sink, also close the drains as they sometimes come out of drains as well. 4. Roaches can survive in the cold but not like it, they usually appear when the weather is warm. Since I know there are roaches in my neighborhood and I have the problem in my apartment every year, I call an exterminator the day I see a roach. When the weather gets warm, seeing one of them mean more of them will come very soon, sometimes even within hours.5. I'm afraid there's no good solution other than calling an exterminator if you see more than one roach within a week when the weather is warm. Spraying poison in the apartment just once sometimes doesn't work too well. (It doesn't in my apartment.) The best way is to call an exterminator, and then 7-15 days later once again. You will probably see couple dead ones but very soon they will all move away to a safe place.6. Make sure you keep a Raid in the house for emergencies.  Embed Quote"

Even in developed countries, nobody does this. Mosquitoes enter houses from the outside, so most mosquito abatement strategies deal with removing mosquito breeding sites outside (such as eliminating puddles or insecticide-treated pools or using oil or using mosquitofish) and preventing bites indoors. People in developing nations can't afford insect repellants or insecticide sprays, so they either use traps or, most commonly, insecticide-treated bed nets.What are the health impacts of insecticide-treated bed nets on children? Reduced child mortality by 20%. According to UNICEF, one in five childhood deaths in Africa is caused by malaria, and a child dies from malaria every 30 seconds. If that sounds ridiculous to you, I remind you that Earth's population is at 7billion and growing, and malaria was and probably still is the number once cause of death among humans, period. Bed nets last for about 5 years and practically prevent all mosquito bites on children who sleep on them: in the unlikely event that the bed nets pose a health risk, such risks would be nothing compared to the almost certain mortality and morbidity from not using them. Unfortunately, few children use these bed nets, as locals tend to give the nets to older (and less at risk) persons because in societies with high childhood mortality the life of an elder is worth more than that of a child. It's a pity, but bed nets are still increasing in usage and the fight against vector-borne diseases continues.  Embed Quote"

The roof was poorly done on the addition to the house and two of the gutters were backed up. While I have dealt with these two problems, water had gotten into the house and some of the wood has rotted away.I noticed a tree stump approximately 9 feet from this addition that had been cut down but not removed. When I pulled the stump up (it was rotten) I noticed a rather large number of orange-looking ants or termites. I have not yet pulled up the sub-floor in the addition to see if these ants/termites are in the house but I was hoping to make some sort of termite bait/killer and place it in the stump and a few other areas of the property before I decide to try store-bought termite bait or go with a professional. Today when I visit the property I will take another good look at the insects and take a picture or find one on Google that resembles them. Either way, they are wood-dwelling insects and should be dealt with.I did a search on Google and the only suggestion I found was a mixture of 1 part cornmeal, 2 parts confectioners sugar, and 2 parts borax. Does this sound effective or are there any better (homemade) solutions?","Termites love to eat soft wood, so by providing them with another source yourself, you can try to get them out of their nest and onto your disposable source. A good trick is to bring out some loose cardboard boxes or pieces and place them in strategic areas such as near the tree stump you saw. They will surely be attracted to this ""soft wood"" type of material and come out to feast on it! Once they do, you can simply burn these items away, burning the termites at the same time. One you've done this a couple of times, you should start looking to renovate this  home and make sure to use materials that are not termite-friendly. Add plenty of gutters that move rainwater away from the foundation of the home so the infrastructure is not penetrated and does not get damp.  Embed Quote"

In this sense, organic food is inherently grown without chemical pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, etc. In addition, organic farmers promote complex interactions between plants, animals, and ecosystems that are not found on industrial farms, whether conventional or certified USDA organic. Such interactions may include utilizing rotational grazing instead of feeding grain to livestock, or using multiple crops in the same space instead of separating them. In short, this method of farming uses systemic, holistic approaches, rather than input substitution. Organic food in this sense is better for you and for the environment.Conversely, organic food may also refer to food labeled as such according to USDA standards, and whether this food is better is less obvious and can depend on the situation.For example, USDA organic certification mandates that cattle receive 30% of their diet from grazing. While their remaining diet may include certified organicgrain, cattle’s digestive systems evolved to process grass, and feeding themgrain causes health problems and results in beef that contains fewer nutrientsimportant to human health (such as vitamins and Omega 3 fatty acids). In thiscase, grass-fed beef may be better for you than organic beef.Another example involves non-certified organic polyculture as compared to certified organic monoculture. USDA organic standards allow monocultures, that is, large areas populated by a single crop type. Monoculture crops can produce a myriad of detrimental environmental effects, including stripping the soil of its nutrients (which can in turn result in less nutritious food), disrupting ecosystems, and jeopardizing biodiversity. Is organic monoculture better for the environment? Perhaps yes, if compared to conventional monoculture, and perhaps not, if compared to a non-certified polyculture that does not use chemical inputs.Farmers that practice organic agricultural methods in the first sense may choose to not certify their products as USDA organic for several reasons, including the cost of certification or disagreement over the value of USDA standards. I once met a dairy farmer who implemented many environmentally sustainable practices on his farm, but chose not to pursue certification because he thought it was cruel to not treat dairy cows with antibiotics when their udders were infected. USDA organic certification also does not address some important concepts in sustainable eating such as the nutritional and environmental costs of shipping food long distances, or the benefits of eating seasonally.While USDA organic certifications do not necessarily equate to healthier or moreenvironmentally friendly food, the standards are relatively new (the OrganicFoods Production Act passed in 1990) and are still being revised (amendments to the act including stricter standards on the treatment of livestock, among other things, will take effect this July). Several states and countries have organic certifications that differ from USDA standards, some of which attempt to more tightly embrace the emulation of natural plant and animal systems.Food may also be labeled according to other terms, such as “all natural”,“environmentally friendly”, or “Earth Friendly, Farm Friendly”. While theselabels may be accurate, they are not monitored or enforced by a governing body and there are no legally mandated national standards to which they must adhere. In fact, the “Earth Friendly, Farm Friendly” label is condoned by anorganization (the Center for Global Food Issues) partially funded by Monsanto that is anti-organic, and the Union of Concerned Scientists advises avoidingproducts with this label (according to their publication Earthwise).In sum, organic food is usually better for you and for the environment. However,in order to know for sure you must know the practices used when growing a particular food item, and because of ambiguous labeling this is often difficult.  Embed Quote"

[1]) - but in general, fruits from the Rosaceae family (apples, peaches, nectarines, and strawberries), have the highest levels of neurotoxic pesticide contamination. However, most non-organic vegetables (except celery) do not contain such dangerous pesticides, so they probably aren't much more risky.The Rosaceae trees are also sprayed with neurotoxic herbicides that the USDA doesn't even measure - like paraquat and ziram - see What crops are most likely to be contaminated with ziram? Or paraquat?I haven't found any studies on the negative effects on people who consume the fruits yet (they also depend on the extent to which exposure to pesticides in food contributes to blood levels of pesticides in food), but there are studies that have found neurotoxic effects in people who simply live near fields that have been sprayed with pesticides (listed below). In that case, until we learn more, there is definitely good reason to advise caution with eating non-organic fruit from the Rosaceae trees if you naturally eat a lot of fruit.I don't think that you should worry about an increased risk of cancer (see Are we exposed to more carcinogens now than any other time in history?) or decreased lifespan at all. But there is a risk that all the pesticide residue could make you dumber if you eat a lot of fruit (this is more relevant for vegetarians/vegans than for most others).

In reality, many of the ""most contaminated"" vegetables actually contain a lot of the more benign pesticides like the neonicotinoids. Also, note that the neurotoxic organophosphate Azinphos methyl will be banned by the EPA in mid-2012.=====So what's up with some of the pesticides I mentioned? Some of them have nasty neurological effects that have been demonstrated in people who simply live near areas where pesticides are sprayed (effects such as significant increases in one's risk of Parkinson's Disease, and yes - even decreases in intelligence). Many of these effects are not effects that you can capture through mortality data in animal (or human studies), and were only discovered in the last few years, so any conclusions (prior to 2010) about the safety of such pesticides are now moot.Now, do these effects transfer to consumers? We don't know yet. But we *do* know that they *do* apply for people who simply *live* near areas where pesticides are sprayed. Also - you can't get rid of pesticides by washing your produce: http://www.reddit.com/r/askscien... . And the major route of exposure to organophosphates (in children) is through food (see http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/artic... )Keep in mind that humans are especially vulnerable to neurological effects (there aren't really any animals that naturally develop Alzheimer's or Parkinson's - so any neurotoxicity will be underreported in most animal studies, and completely glossed over in lifespan studies. They often develop plaques but with no clear evidence of mental decline). See http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/... and Are there any animals that don't get Alzheimer's Disease?With that said - I'm not totally sure if pesticides do that much damage to the brains of most people, give...

Sounds scary. But realistically? What's the objective measurement here? You need a lot more data to prove this is clinically significant. If the level at which harm is seen is X and children on organic diets have 0.2X and children on conventional diets have 0.4X, does it really matter? Can you even prove it's due to diet, not other factors? Another study showed that household use of pesticides, NOT diet, predicted urinary insecticide levels.One study actually showed that consumption of organic meat in winter was a risk factor for infection with Campylobacter bacteria. So...this meat is more expensive, and it might cause greater rate of infection? Where exactly is the so-called benefit of being organic here?6 studies ""found no consistent differences in plasma or urine carotenoids, polyphenols, vitamins E and C content, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, antioxidant activity, ability to protect against DNA damage, immune system markers, or semen quality between participants consuming organic and conventional diets"" Again, not seeing any real benefits of spending lots of money for the organic label here...151 studies reported that harvesting or processing methods were the same for both organic and conventional foods; the rest didn't actually describe harvesting or processing methods. I find it rather difficult to believe that in the studies that did not report these methods, they were significantly different; if they were, any researcher worth their salt would've realized it would be an awesome conclusion to report.""We did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products"" So...maybe shopping for organic food only doesn't necessarily enhance vitamin intake...?A few studies found that organic milk and chicken had higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. However, several studies showed that the season of sampling and brand affected these levels at LEAST as much as the farming method. Seriously, if you're that worried about omega-3 intake, you can get a year's supply for about $10 at Amazon or Costco. Much more cost-effective if you ask me.No difference in protein/fat between organic and conventional milk.Some studies showed higher levels of pesticide residues in conventional produce. Each study had a slightly different level of what was considered ""positive"", though. If you look at studies examining the prevalence of contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits, two studies showed no difference, and one actually showed 6% in organic vs. 2% in conventional...Prevalence of E. coli contamination in produce was 7% in organic vs. 6% in conventional. Of the 5 studies examining this, 4 showed higher risk for contamination among organic produce.""differences in the prevalence of bacterial contamination between organic and conventional animal products were statistically insignificant"" Interesting part: if you look at just pork, 65% of organic pork was contaminated with E. coli vs. 49% of conventional.""No significant differences were found in the ascorbic acid content of cabbage (3 studies), carrots (3 studies), potatoes (3 studies), or tomatoes (8 studies); beta-carotene content of tomatoes (3 studies); or protein content of wheat (6 studies) when grown organically versus conventionally.""I should note some of the problems with research in this field:Over half of studies don't actually list what on earth their standard for considering a product ""organic"" was. Why is this a problem? Well, European Union has one, many European countries have country-specific additional standards, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements has another, and the U.S. Dept of Agriculture has yet another. They all have slightly different requirements.Some papers have really, really small sample sizes. Like...only 6 study subjects. It's kind of impossible to rely on such a study for a generalized view of humanity.Some papers have really, really short time periods. Like...only 2 days. It's kind of impossible to rely on such a study for a generalized view of longitudinal health outcomes 10, 20, 30 years down the line.Data analyzing produce can come from specialized experimental farms, which can control for factors such as weather, geography, etc; however, almost a third came from commercial farms that have no control over these factors, which may affect study results.There are no long-term studies of populations subsisting more on either organic or conventional foods, isolating this difference as the only variable. This is basically impossible at this time and for the near future for obvious logistical reasons.Hope this helps.  Embed QuoteThis answer is not a substitute for professional medical advic...

And it shouldn't need to be said that most of these people have either commercial or ideological motives for extolling the virtues of organic produce. Because of this, their claims about its supposedly superior taste and nutritional value, its lower environmental impact, and so on, should be treated with no less circumspection and objective skepticism than they encourage us to apply to the counter-claims of their non-organic opponents. While some of the claims of the organic lobby may contain a grain of truth, they might still not be true in all circumstances, without exception. And it is relativiely easy to cherry-pick one's data, selecting that which supports one's viewpiont and ignoring that which does not. All successful marketing campaigns employ the dark art of 'creative  statistics'. Other claims for the benefits of organic food are flatly contradicted by the available evidence, and one suspects that those who repeat them and believe them are simply doing so because they have become dogmas and articles of faith within the 'wholefood movement', and to question them is regarded as dangerously heretical. But we must not let profits and politics obscure hard scientific data. Take just a few such claims about organic food, already repeated on here: Firstly, that organic food is more nutritious than conventionally produced food:[The] London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine examined 162 papersthat compared organic and conventionally produced food. They concluded that there was no evidence to back up claims that organic food is more nutritious. http://www.newscientist.com/arti... (subscription required for full article, but the research cited is below)'Our review indicates that there is currently no evidence to support the selection of organically over conventionally produced foods on the basis of nutritional superiority.' - Alan Dangour, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine’s Nutrition and Public Health Intervention Research Unithttp://www.lshtm.ac.uk/news/2009...Secondly, that organic food carries less risk of bacterial or other contamination:Organic broiler chickens are three times as likely as conventionally-bred poultry to be contaminated with a bacterium that causes food-poisoning, say Danish vets. http://www.newscientist.com/arti...[By] shunning science, organic producers could be increasing consumers' risk of contracting Escherichia coli and other food-borne diseases....In theory, organic food could be more prone to microbial contamination due to the absence of preservatives and the use of manure as fertiliser....Studies carried out on organic and conventional produce by Minnesota farmers in 2004 found that E. coli contamination was 19 times greater on organic farms which used manure or compost less than 12 months old...Another extra risk factor in organic production is the avoidance of fungicides, which can lead to the growth of moulds and increased risk of mycotoxins such as aflatoxin and ergot in crops.http://www.newscientist.com/arti...Thirdly, that food irradiation is dangerous and degrades the nutritional value of foods: There is no evidence that food irradiation is harmful to consumers, and also no evidence that it affects the nutritional quality of food.See preceding link.Fourthly, that organic foods are inherently safer than conventionally produced foods because they are not treated with synthetic agrochemicals and additives:In contrast to the popular perception that chemical residues in food are the major source of food contamination, recent food-borne disease outbreaks have demonstrated that microbial hazards are much more significant for food safety (Cliver, 1999). The risks due to pesticide residues and food additives are relatively minor, compared with both acute and chronic effects caused by microbiological and other naturally occurring toxicants (Fig. 3) (Cliver, 1999). ... In the past decade, outbreaks of human diseases associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits, or unpasteurised products originating from them, have significantly increased in number (Beuchat & Ryu, 1997; Keene, 1999)....consumers’ demand of minimally processed foods has had an apparent adverse influence on food safety (Zink, 1997)....Furthermore, there is no evidence that toxic hazards such as pesticides have had a major impact on total cancer mortality (Fisher & Worth, 1995); populations with diets rich in fruits and vegetables have a substantially lower risk of many types of cancer (Centers for Disease Control, 1999), despite the use of synthetic agrochemicals in conventional farming. Hence, the benefits may outweigh the risks....But neither is the organic label a seal of food safety. Organic refers only to a product that has been produced in accordance with certain standards throughout the production, handling, processing and marketing stages; it does not refer to the characteristics and properties of the finished product. The asserted health benefits are impossible to quantify and do not seem, as yet, to compensate for the increased price. ....Summing up, no hard evidence currently exists to support or refute claims that organic food is healthier and safer than conventional food, or vice versa, and assertions of such kind are inappropriate and not justified....The main health-promoting properties of food, however, lie in their ability to provide the human organism with carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fibre and protective factors needed for growth, repair, reproduction, energy and good health. Plants produce these complex nutrients from water, air, soil and sunlight. How well they do so is under the influence of many environmental and genetic factors, and the type of agriculture is only one variable.- Faidon Magkos, Fotini Arvaniti and Antonis Zampelas, Laboratory of Nutrition and Clinical Dietetics, Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Harokopio Universityhttp://journals.cambridge.org/do...Regarding this last point, I recall reading about a scientist who was strongly pro-organic foods. [1][2]. He believed all the hype and propaganda put out by the wholefood industry, and set out to win the debate for organics by conducting research into the comparative toxicity of organic versus conventionally produced foods, with regard to the levels of carcinogens found in both, from either man-made or naturally occuring sources. The results he found shocked him, and completely reversed his previous beliefs: he discovered that organic foods contain many times (in some cases, thousands of times) more carcinogens than conventionally produced foods! He concluded that this was because the specific genetic varieties of crops chosen for organic agriculture are precisely those that produce the highest levels of natural fungicides, herbicides and pesticides, as these crops will be the most resistant to disease and infestation, and so produce the highest yields and least wastage from crop damage. The irony for organic farmers is that many of these naturally occurring substances are hugely more carcinogenic than the synthetic agrochemicals used in conventional agriculture!   Finally, this research article refutes many of the common claims made by proponents of organic food, particularly concerning claims that organic farming methods do not use any harmful chemicals (false) and are more 'sustainable' (false) and environmentally friendly (false). It makes interesting reading, and also contains an extensive list of references to related scientific ressearch:http://www.gene.ch/gentech/2001/...In summary, when you subtract all of the ideological rhetoric and commercial self-interest that currently distorts their arguments, the claims of organic proponents that 'organic is best' simply don't stand up to impartial scientific scrutiny. This doesn't mean that conventionally produced food is any safer or healthier (though some would argue that it is, at least in some cases). It simply means that organic food has yet to be proven superior in these respects. So continue to consume organic food if you want to, and if you can afford its typically higher prices (though many poorer people cannot, which is probably why organic food consumption has become something of a status symbol of the middle-classes in recent years). I'm willing to concede that some of it may even taste nicer than the conventional alternatives, though there is research that also refutes such claims.(Taste is subjective, of course, and I also wonder how much of this is psychological, with people convincing themselves that it tastes better simply because they have a pre-conceived belief that it should.) Just don't fool yourself into believing that it is any healthier or safer for you, because the jury is still out.[1] I have been wracking my brain to recall his name, so far to no avail, but his research is quite famous. Can anyone help?[2] I'm not sure if this is the same guy, but his research has uncovered more-or-less the same facts: http://texasbot.tripod.com/lovej...  Embed Quote"

Outside of the the US and Canada, some organic certification processes may be dubious. 
  
 Katie is also correct that few long term studies show a nutritional benefit to organic products. But the studies showing the environmental benefits grows stronger each day. 
  
 My general rules of thumb are:
 Buy products grown in season, which tend to have the most time to have accumulated nutrients and is usually also grown closer to home. 
  
 If you can find local and certified organic, bonus! I love supporting my local farmer and his family's health. 
  
 From a nutrition point of view, cook vegetables as minimally as possible and save any cooking fluid for soup. 
  
 Try and have as many colours of the rainbow on your plate from veggies and fruit which will increase the likelihood of an array of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. 
  
 Regardless of organic or not, use good food safe sanitation practices at all times.  Embed Quote"

A very new UK study of cows' milk discovered the organic to be far healthier than non-organic, in terms of fat composition. There are other factors too. Can you get all the pesticide residues out of your non-organic carrot, even if studies claim the nutritional quality matches organic? And what of other factors like freshness? Non organic veg straight from the field of a neighbouring farm is likely to have a lot more vitamins in it than something organic that has been kicking around in the retail system for days on end. But like for like, organic is surely the best.  Embed Quote"

What follows comes from the Organic Consumers Association:Beyond Frankenfoods and Toxics: OCA’s Ten Reasons to Buy OrganicOrganic foods and products are the fastest growing items in America's grocery carts. Thirty million households, comprising 75 million people, are now buying organic foods, clothing, body care, supplements, pet food, and other products on a regular basis. Fifty-six percent of U.S. consumers say they prefer organic foods.Here are 10 reasons why you should buy organic foods and products:1. Organic foods are produced without the use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Consumers worry about untested and unlabeled genetically modified food ingredients in common supermarket items. Genetically engineered ingredients are now found in 75% of all non-organic U.S. processed foods, even in many products labeled or advertised as “natural.” In addition the overwhelming majority of non-organic meat, dairy, and eggs are derived from animals reared on a steady diet of GM animal feed. Although polls indicate that 90% of Americans want labels on gene-altered foods, government and industry adamantly refuse to respect consumers’ right to know, understanding quite well that health and environmental-minded shoppers will avoid foods with a GMO label.2. Organic foods are safe and pure. Organic farming prohibits the use of toxic pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones, nano-particles, and climate-destabilizing chemical fertilizers. Consumers worry about pesticide and drug residues routinely found in non-organic produce, processed foods, and animal products. Consumer Reports has found that 77% of non-organic produce items in the average supermarket contain pesticide residues. The beef industry has acknowledged that 94% of all U.S. beef cattle have hormone implants, which are banned in Europe as a cancer hazard. Approximately 10% of all U.S. dairy cows are injected with Monsanto and Elanco’s controversial genetically engineered Bovine Growth Hormone, banned in most industrialized nations. Recent studies indicate that an alarming percentage of non-organic U.S. meat contains dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria.3. Organic foods and farming are climate-friendly. Citizens are increasingly concerned about climate-destabilizing greenhouse gas pollution (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide), 35-50% of which in North America comes from our energy-intensive, chemical-intensive food and farming system. Organic farms and ranches, on the other hand, use far less fossil fuel and can safely sequester large amounts of CO2 in the soil (up to 7,000 pounds of CO2 per acre per year, every year.) Twenty-four billion pounds of chemical fertilizers applied on non-organic farms in the U.S. every year not only pollute our drinking water and create enormous dead zones in the oceans; but also release enormous amounts of nitrous oxide, a super potent, climate-destabilizing greenhouse gas.4. Organic food certification prohibits nuclear irradiation. Consumers are justifiably alarmed about irradiating food with nuclear waste or electron beams, which destroy vitamins and nutrients and produce cancer-causing chemicals such as benzene and formaldehyde. The nuclear industry, large food processors, and slaughterhouses continue to lobby Congress to remove required labels from irradiated foods and replace these with misleading labels that use the term ""cold pasteurization."" The USDA and large meat companies have promoted the use of irradiated meat in school lunches and senior citizen facilities. Many non-organic spices contain irradiated ingredients.5. Consumers worry about rampant e-coli, salmonella, campylobacter, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and fecal contamination in animal products coming out of the nation’s inhumane and filthy slaughterhouses. The Centers for Disease Control have admitted that up to 76 million Americans suffer from food poisoning every year. Very few cases of food poisoning have ever been linked to organic farms or food processors.6. Consumers are concerned about billions of pounds of toxic municipal sewage sludge dumped as “fertilizer” on 140,000 of America’s chemical farms. Scientific evidence has confirmed that municipal sewage sludge contains hundreds of dangerous pathogens, toxic heavy metals, flame-retardants, endocrine disruptors, carcinogens, pharmaceutical drugs and other hazardous chemicals coming from residential drains, storm water runoff, hospitals, and industrial plants. Organic farming categorically prohibits the use of sewage sludge.7. Consumers worry about the routine practice of grinding up slaughterhouse waste and feeding this offal and blood back to other animals, a practice that has given rise to a form of human mad-cow disease called CJD, often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. Animals on organic farms cannot be fed slaughterhouse waste, manure, or blood—daily rations on America’s factory farms.8. Consumers care about the humane treatment of animals. Organic farming prohibits intensive confinement and mutilation (debeaking, cutting off tails, etc.) of farm animals. In addition to the cruel and unhealthy confinement of animals on factory farms, scientists warn that these CAFOs (Confined Animal Feeding Operations) produce enormous volumes of manure and urine, which not only pollute surface and ground water, but also emit large quantities of methane, a powerful climate-destabilizing greenhouse gas.9. Consumers are concerned about purchasing foods with high nutritional value. Organic foods are nutritionally dense compared to foods produced with toxic chemicals, chemical fertilizers, and GMO seeds. Studies show that organic foods contain more vitamins, cancer-fighting anti-oxidants, and important trace minerals.10. Consumers care about preserving America’s family farms, world hunger, and the plight of the world’s two billion small farmers. Just about the only small farmers who stand a chance of making decent living these days are organic farmers, who get a better price for their products. In addition study after study has shown that small organic farms in the developing world produce twice as much food per acre as chemical and GMO farms, while using far less fossil fuel and sequestering large amounts of excess CO2 in the soil. Yields on organic farms in the industrialized world are comparable to the yields on chemical and GMO farms, with the important qualification that organic farms far out-produce chemical farms under extreme weather conditions of drought or torrential rains. Of course given accelerated climate change, extreme weather is fast becoming the norm.For all these reasons, millions of American consumers are turning to organic foods and other organic items, including clothing and body care products--part of an overall movement toward healthy living, preserving the environment, and reversing global warming.http://www.commondreams.org/view...  Embed Quote"

When eating organic fruits and vegetables, the amount of pesticide residue is dramatically reduced and when eating organic meat, you are not running the risk of ingesting growth hormone or antibiotics.                                                     For more Health and Fitness Tips Follow me on Twitter @JackKenefick or on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/OrangeC....

If you're very concerned, put one in every room. If you live near a major highway, don't leave your windows open at night as that's when all the heavy duty, black smoke belching trucks come by.If you haven't already, consider using face wash and lotion daily. Beijing is very dry compared to most temperate US cities, this compounds with the pollution to irritate the skin. Outdoors:Check the pollution index every day (http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/). The pollution is especially bad after sunset, but is lowest in the morning. If you want to go running outside, do it in the morning, and not at night. There are many masks to choose from, but you'll want one with a rating of N90 and above. That means it filters out 90% of airborn particles. Here's what a simple one looks like. You can find these in 7-11, and they are inconspicuous Beijing pollution levels average around an index of 100, which is ""unhealthy"". Even if the pollution is below 100 in the daytime, it almost always jumps up at night. If you ride a bicycle you're going to be smack dab in the middle of the main cause of pollution, cars. You'll want a heavier mask like one of these:Live the cyberpunk dystopian future, today!Be sure to check your filters and replace them! (picture is from a cyclist who reported this was from just one day of biking!)Rain and effects on pollution levelsIn Beijing, pollution levels drop drastically the day after it rains, approaching the tolerable levels of an American city such as New York. These are the most pleasant days and are sunny too. But the heavy cloudy days building up to rain can be quite high in pollution levels. But remember, when that rain is falling, it's carrying everything in the Beijing air with it. Wash your clothes as soon as you can, I've had a rain soaked white shirt left unwashed overnight and now it's been permanently stained with blacksih spots. Wash it off your skin as soon as you can.Enjoy Beijing, and cherish the days where the sun shines brightly on a blue sky  Embed Quote"

Gross.The morning after we bought the filter was the first time since moving to Beijing that I didn't wake up with a sore throat from having a runny nose all night. I was sold.This filter did fine, but we eventually upgraded to a BlueAir. I didn't notice any difference between it and the Midea; I just kept not having a cough or a sore throat from the pollution. The BlueAir was nice, though, because it was quieter than the Midea, and we got it at a great price.Now, expats in Beijing love to talk air purifiers and show off their latest, expensive, buy, but I think that you're fine buying any HEPA purifier that can change the air in the room 3+ times/hour. I know others have argued that BlueAir &c are better because of the pre-filtering that takes out chemical fumes from construction and renovation, but if your apartment is full of formaldehyde fumes, maybe you should move.Bought those air-cleaning plants everyone talks about.Do they work? There's quite a bit of research to indicate they do, but I thought the effect (if any) from the plants we bought was much less noticeable than that of our HEPA filter. According to one source (which has a great list of NASA-approved plants for purifying the air), NASA research indicated you should have one plant per 10m^2 of floorspace, so be prepared to buy quite a few. The plants that we had be best luck with was mother-in-law's tongue. They are still going strong after three years.Luckily, most of these air cleaning plants are ubiquitous and cheap, so go to the flower market next to the US Embassy and have fun shopping and haggling over plants. If you want to buy large plants, try to get them from the same seller, as delivery will be included in the price.Bought a totobobo mask.This was sort of a low point of living in Beijing, acceding to the idea that to go outside I really should wear a mask to breathe. However, life was better with the mask than without it, so I wore the damn thing.When you are looking at pollution masks, there are two things to keep in mind: filtering ability and fit. If the mask isn't able to filter fine particles (the lingo most often heard about this is ""N95""), it's worthless. The cloth masks you see people wearing don't do anything for pollution. Similarly, if the mask doesn't have a tight, consistent seal to your face, dirty air leaks in and the mask isn't as effective.We bought totobobo masks, which are great because (a) you can cut them to fit your face, ensuring proper fit, and (b) they have replaceable filters. On bad air quality days, our air filters would go grey after an hour of outdoor wear. (Think about that for a little bit…) This is a photo of my mask with new filters after an hour of wear on an AQI 300+ day.  The main downside to the totobobo is that moisture accumulates inside it. After about an hour of wear I'd need to take it off and swab out the inside.We have left Beijing, mostly because of the air pollution. The government says that it should have the problem fixed in ""five to ten years"". I'm skeptical of that, but hope it's true.  Embed Quote"

And do not run along the ring roads, where there is heavy traffic. If you want to do some excercise, find a gym or club nearby.I have posted some pictures to show you the best time of the year in Beijing.

I'm the nerd that did all the home air experiments and started Particle Counting. I started to get really concerned about air pollution during the ""airpocalypse,"" but I was shocked at having to spend $1,000 on a single air purifier (let alone the replacement filters). So I researched how filters work and made my own. I posted all of my data and tests online, for example: 1. Live test of the filter2. Tests showing the DIY filter gets an average of 84% of particles larger than .5 microns and 92% of particles larger than 2.5 microns3. Tests of a newer, stronger model that gets 96% of both!Instructions on how to make one are on the Tumblr. However, several people told me they were having trouble finding the parts, so I've started ordering in bulk and shipping from Smart Air. My hope is that my nerd-ery can help people stay healthy without giving a wheelbarrow full of cash to filter companies.And Luke, you're right--particles aren't everything. If people are concerned about fumes from construction, you can add an activated carbon filter to the DIY pretty easily.  Embed Quote"

Being in a car with no windows open makes a HUGE difference on your air quality. I learned that from a UN researcher in an Environment of China class. When pollution measures are off the charts (which happens a couple times a month), avoid going outside altogether. This might sound extreme, but if you plan on living in Beijing for years plural, its important. Lung related illnesses are the number one cause of death in Beijing. To know when the weather is bad, get a VPN and follow @beijingair on Twitter. It's a device that measures pollution by parts per million and I believe its on top of the US embassy in Beijing. It's also worthwhile to understand what the measures mean. The smaller the particles, the worse for your lungs. Everyone was freaking out with all the construction dust before the Olympics, but that just makes your boogers blacks, not a big deal.  Embed Quote"

Trees remove gaseous pollutants by absorbing them through the pores in the leaf surface. Particulates are trapped and filtered by leaves, stems and twigs, and washed to the ground by rainfall.Air pollutants injure trees by damaging their foliage and impairing the process of photosynthesis (food making). They also weaken trees making them more susceptible to other health problems such as insects and diseases.The loss of trees in our urban areas not only intensifies the urban ""heat-island"" effect from loss of shade and evaporation, but we lose a principal absorber of carbon dioxide and trapper of other air pollutants as well.Some of the major air pollutants and their primary sources are:Carbon dioxide: Burning oil, coal, natural gas for energy. Decay and burning of tropical forests.Sulfur dioxide: Burning coal to generate electricity.Hydrogen floride and silicon tetrafloride: Aluminum and phospate fertilizer production, oil refineries, and steel manufacturing.Ozone: Chemical reactions of sunlight on automobile exhaust gases. Ozone is a major pollutant in smog.Methane: Burning fossil fuels, livestock waste, landfills and rice production.Nitros oxides: Burning fossil fuels and automobile exhausts.Chloroflorocarbons: Air conditioners, refrigerators, industrial foam.The burning of fossil fuels for energy and large scale forest fires such as in the tropics are major contributors to the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere.Managing and protecting forests and planting new trees reduces CO2 levels by storing carbon in their roots and trunk and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.[3]Reference:Forest Service Study Finds Urban Trees Removing Fine Particulate Air Pollution, Saving Lives.Trees Reduce Air PollutionTrees Capture Particulate Matter From Road ExhaustModeled PM2.5 removal by trees in ten U.S. ci...

I curse myself daily for being born in a hindu family.,"Chill, dude.Pollution is not anywhere in the top 10 list of horrible things about Hinduism in particular, or religions (all of them) in general. There are people out there killing other people in the name of religion (and this is true of most major religions of the world). Do you really want to get worked up over pollution?As to why this is a part of Hinduism, the simple answer is that this made much more sense 2500 years ago when these rituals were probably first practiced. In those days, with much lower populations, and societies living close to nature, pollution was not a problem. Fire was what separated humans from the animals, and was great for purification, cooking and other ""good"" things. There was no electricity, or natural gas, so all heating required coal or wood.Some of these rituals don't make sense now - but the nature of religions (as most people follow them) makes it difficult to adapt to modern conditions.  All religions suffer from this problem of having to follow rituals and rules that made sense thousands of years ago, but don't any longer.And finally, do you really think that pollution due to havans is really a pressing problem? Have you tried to estimate how much of the pollution in India is caused by havans, and how much is caused by your motorcycle, and how much was caused by the factories that built the laptop and mobile phone you're using?  Embed Quote"

I curse myself daily for being born in a hindu family.,"As Navin Kabra rightly highlighted in his answer, the rituals were designed to serve a purpose but are not adapted to current living standards and environment.As far as havans/yagnas are concerned, it was/is considered a good thing to offer specific materials to the fire as the heating of them in certain proportion would cleanse the environment and have positive impact on the body and soul. The Rishis of those times were also experts in Ayurveda and other medicines. So they mostly came up with such rituals where positive effects of such havans can be reached to a good number of people. One such example is the bonfire at the night of Holi (Holika Dahan). Originated from a religious believes, this fire does cleanse the air from the insects that specifically originates in fields after winter harvest.So in some cases, the rituals were originally started to have a positive impact but probably over the time they might have become a reason for pollution. But again, how much is their contribution to over all rise of pollution in recent times?  Embed Quote"

I curse myself daily for being born in a hindu family.,"All religions worship the higher source/energy in the form of fire, seen as lighting candles or lamps during prayers. It’s an ancient method of submitting the pleas and prayers to the higher source beseeching their Divine blessings.Only difference is lighting candles and lamps have invisible toxic gases (CO2 and CO mainly) while Havan has visible fumes due to solid substances being burnt. and believe me these gases produced by lamps/candles are as toxic as burning any form of gasoline which is far worse than outcomes of Havan.Few images to prove what other religion followers are doing:Christians (candles/lamps):Shingon Buddism (fire):Islam (another form of pollution):So as every other religion has some ceremony you can call pollution until you do some research and get to real meaning of those acts.Coming back to Havan again:In fact Havan is performed as a personal ritual performed for the benefit of the society or the whole living beings.Havan(Homam) is not just burning some woods and eatables for sake of performing a typical ritual with no reasons. Though I am sure lot of people does not know the real benefits behind the act. Here are few facts about ingredients used in Havan and their benefits: 1. Havan Samagri(a mixture of various dried herbal medicines, roots and leaves) is offered in the blazed fire which disseminates in micro form, in the air, to purify the environment besides activating the air as disinfectant germicidal agent.2. Pure Ghee (Butter made from cow milk) is burned in fire which gets converted into micro form to purify damp air.3. Camphor (Kapoor):Camphor is used in almost all Havan ceremonies. Camphor is a cough suppressant which helps avoid cough to the people performing Havan as they have to sit next to fire during ceremony. Camphor will deter snakes and other reptiles due to its strong odor. Similarly, camphor is believed to be toxic to insects and is thus sometimes used as a repellent.There are many different thing which seem illogical at first but they make lot of sense when you go behind the real reasons.I am sure you will start feeling very blessed one day when you understand real essence behind Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism). Hinduism is not just a religion but it's a way of life!  Embed Quote"

Currently the two compounds that we are most concerned about for health reasons are ozone and PM.Ozone is not directly released to the atmosphere but is formed from the reactions of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight. Nitrogen oxides are emitted from cars, trucks and power plants. Hydrocarbons are also emitted from vehicles but have other man-made (industrial, household chemicals, paints, etc.) and natural (vegetation) sources as well.Particulate matter (PM) in smog has direct emission sources from cars and trucks, but these are overwhelmed by the PM that is chemically formed in the atmosphere. PM contains various chemical compounds: organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and elemental carbon make up most of the mass. Organics have direct sources from cars and trucks, but are mostly formed in the atmosphere from hydrocarbons emitted from man-made and natural sources. Sulfate is formed from sulfur dioxide that has large sources from coal-fired power plants. Nitrate is formed from nitrogen oxides from vehicles and power plants. Ammonium is formed from ammonia from agriculture and vehicles. Nitrate is more abundant at cooler temperatures, as it forms a volatile salt with ammonium, ammonium nitrate, that is more stable at lower temperatures. Elemental carbon, also called black carbon, is directly emitted from predominantly Diesel vehicles.  Embed Quote"

Industries such as cement, steel, and power generation create massive amounts of particulate matter (PM2.5) in the course of their normal operations. These emissions are controlled by the use of a dust collection system (known as a baghouse). These systems suck up the fugitive dust, or dust-laden air and send it through a fabric filter (baghouse filter), which traps the dust particles but allows the air to pass through. In areas where smog and PM pollution are notoriously high, such as in Southern California, the emissions limits for PM2.5 VOCs (Volatile Organic Chemicals) and mercury (now also nationwide) are much stricter than in other places due to their direct role in the formation of smog. In these places usually factories, and industrial sites in general will have to constantly monitor the amount of particulate that is being exhausted into the atmosphere. If they exceed their limit for any substantial period of time (sometimes only hours) they face massive fines and even being shut down by the regulatory bodies.

Lots of Gen Y'ers [1] no longer buy a TV, stereo, radio, or numerous other appliances - simply because they can get everything they need off the Internet. Similarly, with the spread of digital distribution, Gen Y'ers are now buying physical media less and less too. So it translates into far less energy used to make things (and reduced CO2 emissions).The Internet has also significantly decreased the amount of mail the post office has to process through (which has caused some funding crises in the post office) - and it also has spelled trouble for the newspaper industry. But do you know what this means? Fewer trees are killed [2]. With e-readers on the rise, this is also more likely to happen with books.As some people prefer Internet interaction to long-distance interaction (in many cases - sure it's more rewarding to interact in real-life with your close friends, but with those who you aren't so close to, is it really that much more rewarding?), they drive less and take the airplane less. This means reduced CO2 emissionsTelecommuting also has significant potential, and could easily reduce the amount people need to commute. This also means reduced CO2 emissionsNow, let's not deny that computers have to use electricity and pump CO2 into the atmosphere. But really - the fact is - people are going to need a computer no matter what these days (so there's just a fixed lump sum production cost that is going to be happen anyways), and computers are not particularly more energy intensive than a 100-Watt lightbulb. In fact, I can definitely say that thanks to the Internet, I won't need as big of a house as I thought I would need (in the future), since most of the things I need will be in digital form.There are other names used for this new era - the ""digital transformation"", and the ""post-materialistic"" ageNow, using Chris Riso's recent report, we can also expect a savings of...186 MtCO2e from e-commerce533 MtCO2e from telecommuting181 MtCO2e from teleconferencing61 MtCO2e from dematerializationAnd it all adds up to a savings of 961 MtCO2e.

Would this not solve most of China's air pollution problem? What's preventing it from happening?,"Adding to Kirk's good answer, air pollution in China is not that simple, and there are several answers to your question.Of course, there are things that major factories could do. The central government is currently in a serious campaign to make factories upgrade their facilities, but this is harder than it sounds. The central government is authoritarian but not as powerful as many outside China imagine. Many large factories are protected by local governments through some combination of being important to local production numbers and employment, and outright corruption. There are lots of other factories that are small, gray-market affairs - literally, a dozen people in a corrugated steel shed with some equipment and a smokestack - and it's hard to find them all and even harder to make them clean. Even if you shut them down, they open again next week somewhere else.But lots of air pollution is not caused by factories (I don't have actual proportions, maybe someone can find some numbers.) Some is caused by mining, some is caused by farmers burning agricultural waste, some is caused by trucks, tractors, etc, burning dirty fuel, and an increasing amount of it is caused by middle class people driving cars. All of these require their own solutions.The central government actually has figured out over the past year or two (too late or not, we will find out) that air pollution is a problem that needs to be solved - not an unfortunate by-product of development, but an existential crisis that is killing growth and if not addressed has the potential to end Party rule in China. So now air pollution is being treated very, very seriously. Teams of environmental inspectors from Beijing are being sent down to the provinces to do tests. State-owned firms are getting the message that now is the time to make those changes they have been dragging their feet on. Lower grades of coal and diesel are being phased out. Restrictions on car ownership and use are spreading.The consensus I have heard from both Chinese and foreigners who follow China is that all this will have results. But it will take time, just as it did in the West. London and LA both had serious air pollution problems (the kind that killed a lot of people) and both solved them, but it took decades.  Embed Quote"

Would this not solve most of China's air pollution problem? What's preventing it from happening?,"It's not that easy.  Public policy usually isn't.One major problem is that air pollution is regional.  For example, the thing about Beijing air pollution is that most of it comes from outside of Beijing.  If the coal factories that caused Beijing pollution were located in Beijing it would be easy to deal with, but since they come from other provinces, the companies there are in no mood to install any sort of equipment which costs them a lot but doesn't benefit them.At that point you have to deal with things at the national level.  First of all this involves balancing Beijing's interests with other interests, which means a lot of meetings which take a lot of time.  Second you have the problem that even if the national government issues an order, all of the implementation takes place locally which means that you have to find some mechanism to insure that local governments aren't just reporting that they are following instructions and then ignore them. None of this is unfixable, but it involves a lot of meetings and negotiations, and will take a few years.  It's been done before.  The United States ran into exactly the same problem, and one of the nice things about the Clean Air Act is the it gives a pretty good mechanism for how to deal with air pollution.  Essentially the Federal government issues standards, but state governments are required to come up with the way of actually meeting those standards and the EPA and state government agree as to what needs to be done and how.  Embed Quote"

However, I'm going to speak from a North American perspective (Hong Kong, as Anonymous points out, has different sources of air pollution, given 90% of people take transit there already). I argue that land use, not public transit, plays a bigger factor in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Without proper land use, you can have lots of buses go any where, but they wouldn't be able to meet the right ridership since everything is far apart. As Seth Andrzejewski points out, land use is very critical. Your goal: you want to be able to reduce the travel time from your origin to your place of destination, so you choose the mode of transportation that is the least costly, from a time and monetary perspective. You want to reduce the time it takes to take to get to work or buy groceries. For example, if you can make the places between where you live and the places you want to go (grocery store, work, park, etc.) closer to each other, you make it a lot easier to depend on the car, since things are not spread out. If things are too spread out, the Golden Triangle of Transit here fails:From Jarrett Walker, international transit consultant: (Human Transit: basics: conceptual triangles).In short, without the right density and walk-ability, transit services can't justify frequent services (buses coming every five minutes!) or have the right ridership to meet the service. This is why in a lot of suburbs, you have buses coming every 30 minutes or hour: it is much more cheaper for them to take that route because not many people take transit.Without proper land use planning (which is a whole other subject on its own, as the comments on Seth's post point out), like in the US, you have a lot of suburbs, which makes it more convenient to drive than to take transit.  Jarrett Walker, from his book, Human Transit: How clearer thinking about public transit can enrich our communities and our lives (see here: human transit (the book): introduction ) notes that if land use (""development"") is spread out, transit would not be very efficient:The red line is the transit line, the dark purples are the first and last stops, and the light purple are the intermediate stops. If we pretended, this was a suburb, having cul-de sacs (in light purple) would not be very efficient for transit vehicles because  the bus/rail would have to go through every destination. It would take a really long time for that red line to go to every place. This is a different transit line, but much more straight forward. Now, with the proper land use that is very dense in one line, this can be a very efficient transit line. This is key: proper land use. You can still have a straight line but it can be located in the suburbs, and it would be an inefficient transit line because there is not enough ridershipHere's an example of density, visualized, from the architecture firm, Perkins & Will, of a urban design plan for Vancouver, Canada, I believe. Here's another similar image of Vancouver, probably at a different location:Watch that transit line pass through that dense neighborhood! With the amount of development, it will have a justifiable amount of ridership to justify frequent service along the line to take transit!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, in short, land use, not public transit, in North America, has a greater factor in influencing greenhouse gas emissions.Note: you might have noticed that I was sort of repetitive in different ways. It is really important to be clear when discussing or talking about transportation and the language of transportation because people interpret things different ways. That's why I provided lots of different visuals from different sources to help put everything in context.  The concept of density, for example, is a very broad concept. Does it mean 5 story, 10 story, 80 story (Manhattan), etc. There are different ways of measuring high density. Similarly, the concept of mixed land use or closer land uses is also very hard to visualize and thus has to be explained in depth to the reader.This is the role of urban planners, transportation engineers, and also to a growing extent, the smart cities / big data movement, which I talk more about in this article: http://www.quora.com/Smart-Citie...  Embed Quote"

There are many other sources of air pollution, not just from autos. I couldn't immediately find a % breakdown of where air pollution comes from, mainly because it's an apples to oranges comparison. Factories or refineries emit different pollutants than autos.2. The ""public transport"" solution shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a public transport problem. The real problem is how many American cities are organized - where people live, work, and shop. Take ""auto-centric"" Los Angeles for example. It does have a metro, metrorapid bus, and light rail system, mostly serving downtown. For commuting patterns between these points (i.e. from Hollywood to Downtown along the Red Line), there may be a significant transit mode share (say >20%). However, public transport would have to bridge a huge number of possible origin-destination combinations to make a serious dent in auto generated air pollution. People live in Torrence and work to Pasadena, live in Long Beach and work in Santa Monica. It would be much less expensive if we could convince people to live nearer to where they worked.  Embed Quote"

You can use a vacuum cleaner with strong suction power,  rotating brushes and quality filter to ensure that the dirt and dust  does not get blown back out in the exhaust. You need to vacuum high  traffic areas like carpets, walls and upholstered furniture where dust  can easily accumulate. It’s important to wash the air filter also  regularly.Keep dust outside – Shoes can bring in all the  dirt, dust and pollutants from outside into your home. Place mats at the  entrance to your home so that some amount of the pollutants get trapped  on the mat and not on the floors of your home.Mop it up – Mopping the floors of your home cleans  up the leftover dust that vacuuming leaves behind. New micro fiber mops  with plain, clean water can effectively clean the surface area without  the use of harsh cleaners and detergents.Avoid the use of harsh chemicals and cleaners –  Household items like lemon juice, baking soda and vinegar can clean and  disinfect as effectively as conventional cleaners. These items will not  put harsh chemicals in the air. Change AC filters regularly – Proper maintenance of  your AC systems can help with improving indoor air quality. It’s very  important to clean air filters regularly and replace them with new ones  every two or three months. Avoid the use of synthetic fragrances and air fresheners – A combination of various chemicals are used for air fresheners and  fragrances which can irritate people’s nasal passage and lungs. You can  use natural sources like fresh flowers, essential oils to add a pleasant  fragrance indoors. Install plants – A natural way to filter toxins and  purify the air is by keeping plants around the house.  To get the best  results, try incorporating at least fifteen to eighteen plants into a  standard home of 1800 square footage. Test for radon – You could have a radon problem if  you have a new or old home. This odorless, colorless gas raises the  potential for developing lung cancer. If someone in your home smokes,  then your indoors has high radon levels.  Second hand cigarette smoke or  passive smoking is worse as it induces health problems like heart  attacks, lung cancer, breathing problems, etc. Cigarette smoke contains  over 4000 chemicals so whoever smokes indoors in doing harm to  themselves and to others around them. Either it’s best to kick the habit  or smoke outside.  Embed Quote"

Since these sources can not just make you sick but kill you, I strongly encourage people to start with the completely unvented sources that pose the greatest risk.  1. Vehicles stored in attached garages:  either store them outside or, as section 403.3 of the Intl Mechanical Code requires, install 100 cfm of continuous [24/7] exhaust per vehicle. This will prevent CO and other pollutants  from entering the rest of the house whenever you start the car.  [this is more likely in winter when it is colder outside garage than inside].   Without such a fan, starting a car in an attached garage is like starting it in your living room.  You can buy whisper quiet fans for under $200 and they cost less than $30 per year in electricity to run. 2. Unvented gas space heaters and gas  log fireplace sets that are wall mounted with fake mantels and no flues: get rid of them!3. Gas ovens and ranges: replace with electric.   Even if you have a vented range hood instead of the kind that just blow air back in your face, the hood is too far above the range top to work effectively, and the typical fan is not powerful enough to keep some CO from accumulating in the room whenever you cook .   If you want to keep using a gas oven or range, make sure the range hood actually vents outdoors and turn it on before you light any burners, as CO production peaks in the first 5 minutes.  And whether gas or electric, always open kitchen windows wide when using that self clean cycle that turns the oven on HI for hours. . 4.Gas water heaters with open flue collars:  these allow combustion gases to spill into the room and can't stop backdrafting.  replace with electric or sealed combustion water heaters. 5. Wood fireplaces:  these also backdraft whenever you decide to let the fire burn out--like when you go to bed on a cold winter night.  As the fire cools, the updraft weakens until it is reversed by cold outsider air falling down the chimney.  This blows across the embers and sends all the combustion gases into the room.   If you want to keep using it, install tight fitting glass doors with air vents in front of the fireplace, and close the air vents when you go to bed. 6. Candles and incense:  no  big problem in small doses, but don't light more than 1 or 2 at a time in any tightly closed room.  Embed Quote"

After renovations or new construction, it can be up to 1,000 times more polluted. One of the biggest sources of indoor air pollution, believe it or not, is the products and materials we use to construct, furnish, and maintain our buildings. This includes drywall, insulation, flooring, kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, mattresses, furniture, electronics, paints, sealants, adhesives, cleaning products, and more. These products can off-gas, or release chemicals, known as VOCs (volatile organic compounds) into the indoor air--compounds like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Exposure to VOCs can cause numerous health problems--from headaches and nausea to dizziness and asthma. In fact, research has shown that children who are exposed to airborne VOCs are four times more likely to develop asthma. The best way to ensure optimal indoor air quality is to practice source control. That means keeping the pollutants out in the first place so you don't ever have to worry about eliminating them. An easy way to do this is to look for GREENGUARD Certified products. They've been scientifically tested and screened for over 10,000 chemicals and proven to meet exceptionally tough chemical emissions criteria. The GREENGUARD Environmental Institute keeps a database of all products that have been certified at www.greenguard.org. There are also plenty of other free tips and interactive tools to check out on GREENGUARD's website to help you better understand indoor air quality.Other tips include ensuring adequate ventilation (including opening your windows to allow fresh outdoor air to come indoors), ensuring that your HVAC filters aren't clogged up, avoiding cleaners with fragrances and/or harsh solvents, and wiping your feet at the door.  Embed Quote This answer needs to disclose relevant affiliations.

""If the 50 most-polluting U.S. power plants were an independent nation,"" reads the report from Environment America Research & Policy Center, an independent nonprofit, ""they would be the seventh-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, behind Germany and ahead of South Korea."" The vast majority of the top 100 offenders—98 of them in fact—are coal plants.Source: Stunning stat: The dirtiest 1% of America's power plants release 33% of America's power-plant carbon emissionsThe EPA tracks these things too, so looking at their answer to this question and sources of information is always worthwhile.Electricity generation is the dominant industrial source of air emissions in the United States today. Fossil fuel-fired power plants are responsible for 67 percent of the nation's sulfur dioxide emissions, 23 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions, and 40 percent of man-made carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions can lead to smog, acid rain, and haze. In addition, these power plant emissions increase the risk of climate change. Congress is currently considering proposals to require further reductions of emissions from power plants, including the President's Clear Skies Initiative. However, renewable energy is receiving increased attention by environmental policymakers because renewable energy technologies have significantly lower emissions than traditional power generation technologies. To find out more about the air emissions generated by U.S. power plants, you can use EPA's Emissions and Generated Resource Integrated Database, or eGRID. eGRID provides emissions data on virtually every power plant and company that generates electricity in the United States.Air Emissions | Clean Energy | US EPA  Embed Quote"

It seems like a no-brainer to me.","The first thing came into my mind is who is responsible to make such kind of public policy in China. The central government probably has more incentives to protect the environment due to the fear of furious citizens going on the street to compromise the already slowly crumbling social stability.But any decision made by the central government has to be enforced by local administration such as province or city government. Officials at this level have a very subtle mentality concerning the politics and their own career goals. Most of them don't have too much political morality about making our society a better one in the future because their children are or will be studying in the western nations and foreseeably will get immigrant identities in the future or at least can travel around the world freely with affluent financial resources so if anything really goes wrong they can just leave. And their political ambition is limited to the scale of getting to a higher position for more political power in exchange for more bribery and a bigger chance to evade the judicial prosecution for their corrupted conduct.That has been said, let's take a closer look at the proposed advantages of your suggestion and what local officials would likely to think about them:a) be on average cost-free to Chinese consumers and exporters: What's the point to make consumers and exporters cost-free? Does that make me richer? Probably not, so why bother?b) cost-effectively reduce pollution: Pollution only matters when it is causing imminent troubles like the PM 2.5 problem haunting many cities recently. But we don't have to do anything other than telling people that it'll take about 50 years to solve the environmental problems. And if we are lucky,  one or two windy days will make the problem disappear and we're good again.c) bring human health benefits: What's the point to make people healthy? Don't tell me it will reduce the medical expenses of the society, it's not my money, and reduce it or not, tax payers will cover it anyway. And FYI I have deluxe medical care package only available for retired government officials and will not be impacted by the deficiency of the public health fund. Lucky me.d) bring ecological benefits: Believe it or not, we and our families work and live in air-conditioned and filtered environment. We eat organic food called special offer. And we barely do any domestic travel anymore.e) make Chinese citizens happier, and therefore happier with their government: What's the point to make your servants happy? They're not happy with the government? Come on, guns in hands we communists fear nothing. :Df) retain the fiscal stimulus effects of existing government spending: We already have good relations with infrastructure contractors who have bigger business and therefore can deliver bigger kickbacks.g) develop Chinese green industry and green engineering skills and innovation: Innovation? Why bring up the only thing we're not good at?h) divert investment away from wasteful and pointless construction projects (which could still be funded in later years, if desired) - which would in itself reduce pollution, and thus reduce the costs of the scheme: I'm tired and my mistresses are waiting. How about take question H as your home work?Sometimes, if you can't understand all the preposterous things in China in a social-economic analytical way, just try to understand it in my way. You'll be enlightened. Cheers!  Embed Quote"

It seems like a no-brainer to me.","Anti-pollution doesn't work well as a fiscal stimulus.  1) The thing about fiscal stimulus is that you want to be able to stop doing it once you reach full employment.  So you hire millions of people building railroads and buildings, and once the economy starts to get back on its feet, *you tell them to stop*.  Anti-pollution is something that China is going to have to spend large amounts of money on over the next several decades, and it not something that you can or should flip on and flip off.2) Most construction jobs don't require a lot of skill.  You take a farmer with a middle school education, give him some tools, and ask him to mix concrete.  For most environment jobs, you can't do this.  Even for a coal factory, you need construction workers that have more skill than you need than to build an apartment complex.3) Anti-corruption - OK, if I pay you $5 million RMB to build apartments, I can see whether or not you in fact actually built apartments.  You may have pocketed some fraction of the money, you may have entered into all sorts of weird deals with local officials, but in the end I can tell that you in fact built the apartments, and since I know what apartments cost to build, it's easy for me to keep you from pocketing all the money.With licenses and pollution caps its harder to tell.  If I pay you money to build apartments, I can tell that you actually built the apartments.  If my goal is to just get money into workers hands, I can just look to see if you have lots of workers, and if they aren't getting paid, they are likely to rat you out.If I pay you money to install anti-pollution devices, it's easier to fool me into thinking that you did so when you didn't.  In situations where there isn't an ""obvious"" thing to be built, it's even worse, cap and trade works rather badly in most developing countries because it requires a very well run and clean government which doesn't exist in China.  I ""sell"" you a license to pollute, and I do it anyway, and if I'm a Party boss, are you going to stop me?One other thing is that ghost cities is more complex than the government ordering someone to do something.  Part of the reasons ghost cities exist is that you cannot own empty land in China.  If you think that a piece of land is going to be valuable in 20 years, you have to build *something* on it, or else you lose it.  Embed Quote"

Why do people who recycle, carpool, drive hybrids, and turn off their lights at home, not realize that a single vacation flight can cancel out many years of all of their other green efforts put together? In other words, these people are behaving extremely irrationally. It would be much greener if they made no effort to be green whatsoever, and simply did not go on international vacations.","I'd say I fit this profile — I recycle, bicycle, don't own a car, compost, let it mellow if it's yellow, buy wind power, etc., but in 2009 I flew more than 70,000 air miles and barely fell short of 50,000 in 2010, which by your calculator gets me easily over 25 tons per year (equivalent to my driving 2.5 Hummers all year). I'm flying mostly for work, not pleasure, but if I were really determined I could have flown much, much less for work. I never in so many words ""claim to support the environment"" but I think I'm otherwise the person you're asking about.The implicit assertions behind your question include: these people are selfish, hypocritical, unaware or have their heads in the sand. I plead no contest on three of four counts: I cannot claim to be unaware of the carbon burden of my flying.There is, of course, no other practical way to go overseas with any kind of timeliness. This is the meta-reason: it's not like the choice is ""fly to Botswana or take a high-speed train to Botswana""; the choice is more ""fly to Botswana or drive to Appalachia"". I think that globetrotting Americans certainly do miss out on the amazing and diverse kinds of beauty you can find in the US—but I'd say Americans who never leave the country are missing out on a basic understanding of their place in the world.A key thing is that not all of these behaviors are only about CO.• Several of the behaviors you list — carpooling, turning off lights — also save money. Saving money means I can buy more tiger bones and polar bear pelts on my decadent international vacations.• Recycling is also about doing less mining and therefore less of the other environmental damage that comes from mining — tailings, runoff, stripping mountaintops, hydrofracking, etc.• Recycling/composting: taking recyclables and compostables out of the waste stream should make for smaller landfills and encourage more responsible/sustainable waste management.• Carpooling/bicycling is also about the health of cities, more reducing traffic congestion, etc. Bicycling and using public transit are also about making better infrastructure.• Hybrids are sort of immaterial since they don't currently really spare any CO over their whole lifecycle anyway. But buying them does encourage the development of other alternatives: it is arguably better for people to be buying hybrids than Hummers just to make it clear that there's a market for greener cars.But I'd say in my case it ultimately comes down to moral-relativistic selfishness. I know it makes tons and tons of CO for me to fly. I know that the only way to reduce the amount of fuel used by the airline industry is for everyone to fly less — putting the lie to my ""encouraging better practices"" justifications for recycling, public transit, and not buying Hummers. But I pretty much willfully ignore the environmental burden of my actions in the case of flying. I love going to distant countries. I don't have time to go by container ship.I don't buy carbon offsets because they seem like a racket with dubious effectiveness. But putting that veneer afterthought of rationality on top of the generally irrational & irresponsible dumping of CO directly into the sky is pretty dumb/hypocritical: I like trees, so any gesture would probably be better than no gesture at all.  Embed Quote"

You're absolutely correct about the emissions of flights. I take about 1-2 international flights a year which alone emits more carbon than the rest of my life. I'm more than aware of that. I also try not to fly more than that much. Here are some things to consider, though:Every little bit of savings counts. Compared to someone who flies 1-2 times a year and doesn't recycle, it's still better to recycle, no?Greenhouse gases are only one of many environmental problems. In fact, greenhouse gases and fuel consumption are probably the only environmental problems caused by aircraft. Recycling and reusing not only reduce carbon emissions but also cut down on waste and conserve natural resources and ecosystems, other very crucial environmental issues today.I'm extremely aggressive in cutting down emissions in the rest of my life. I do not own a car. I bicycle and use public transportation whenever possible, eat vegetarian, pay close attention to buying as much seasonal local produce as possible, don't use an electric dryer or air conditioner, use heating sparingly, and cut my electricity usage to a very bare minimum. My hope is to mindfully take a lot of relatively big measures in parallel all year to reduce my emissions to at least offset some decent fraction of the flight emissions when it all adds up.I feel like the airline industry to some degree reaches limits to how much it is used. Only a small fraction of the world flies frequently. Aircraft CO2 emissions account for about 3% of greenhouse gas emissions in the world -- which is a lot, but I don't believe the number of people who fly will blow up any time soon. However, city planning issues, expansion of suburbia, lack of public transportation options and other environmental issues plague entire populations, and when added up, accounts for a much more than aircraft in the world today. By being environmentally conscious in ones' daily life, one also promotes environmental friendliness in the community and helps encourage others to do so. I can safely say that through my recycling and reusing and energy-saving habits, I've managed to encourage dozens of others to change their habits every year. The power in numbers will hopefully reduce the emissions from the problematic, non-aircraft 97% due to the smaller emissions of everyone added up.There are many instances where flying is the only practical option to get from A to B, especially when there is an ocean in-between, and in some scenarios the only safe option to get from A to B. Many times, there is a goal in mind (for example, visiting relatives, visiting friends, engaging in cultural exchange, learning about aspects of a place that one could not from books and the internet, charity work, seeing and understanding nature that one does not have access to near home, academic work, etc.). At least there is a goal at the other end, and something is getting accomplished. I would never fly to a faraway resort to relax. Any plane travel I take must always be justified by a goal that I would not be able to accomplish by staying at home.You're absolutely right that aircraft CO2 emissions are huge -- I'm not claiming innocence -- I'm just saying that there are more than enough reasons to be environmentally friendly and (humbly) promote environmental awareness even and perhaps especially if you fly, if at least for the lots of other reasons besides CO2 emissions. Being environmental is more about working together, and less about preaching to a crowd. As far as CO2 emissions goes, yes, I emit a lot, and I admit that.  Embed Quote"

It would be much greener if they made no effort to be green whatsoever, and simply did not go on international vacations.","Because the vast majority of people need to live and work using currently available technology - this will always be a constant when dealing with behavior and the environment. Your question assumes that given a set of unfavorable alternatives, the only option is to not participate. Of course you will always have a small segment of a population who chooses not to participate in standard comforts of Western life (like a trip to Europe), but for most people, the world is not binary but rather consists of a continuum of tradeoffs. The difference among most of the population is simply where you sit on that continuum. An environmentally conscious consumer taking a flight is not irrational behavior. This consumer would likely be aware of the tradeoff they are making, but has decided for whatever reason that the benefits outweigh the risks. They are simply choosing the only mode of transport available, given the delta among the alternatives (plane vs boat vs swim). However they will likely continue their green behavior well beyond that trip and continue to take advantage of every green alternative (such as recycling) that is provided to them. If airlines offered cleaner alternatives (they do), then they would likely take that option.We all work within the constraints. The fact that many choose to operate within those constraints rather than to go without is not irrational. In fact, many successful people in the environmental movement have learned to change the system from within, with promising results. Most of us wouldn't recycle if we didn't have a recycling service dropping by our house each week. We wouldn't care about climate change if the world's scientists weren't exposing the risks to us. And we wouldn't care about fuel efficiency if reducing subsidies and declining oil production (among many other things) didn't push our gas prices through the roof. Changing behaviors on a global scale - or the technologies that drive those behaviors -  takes years, sometimes decades. Opting out of choice during these transitions simply isn't an option for most people.  Embed Quote"

Someone who consolidates trips; aggressively seeks air bargains (thus filling seats which may otherwise have gone empty); reduces luggage weight; flies nonstop, even when that means a land trip after arrival; prefers high-altitude airports like Denver or Mexico City (which use much less fuel on take off and landing); and refuses to fly in smaller airplanes; is emitting a lot less marginal CO2 than someone flying first-class on packed, high-season flights. Since my air travel is my largest carbon emissions, I do all of these things; I will customarily accept an extra 12 hours travel time (sleeping on a bus) if it minimizes my air travel emissions. If I'm traveling with my (young) child, of course, the premium on convenience is higher, but I'm still willing to accept significant inconvenience to minimize emissions.(Another ,significant relative CO2 savings would come from sloped runways, to get a gravity assist for both take-off and landing/braking. But currently, no pilots have training for that, and no country's safety regulations would allow it. Oh well.)  Embed Quote"

The matter isn't a complicated one. You have a unit which draws air into it, passes that air through a HEPA filter (usually) and then spits it back out into the room.The CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) will clue you in to how much air it moves around. More is better. The filter efficiency is important, as the percentage is usually outlined somewhere on the package for the sake of clarity. A filter which is 95% effective lets approximately 1 in 20 particles past. A filter that is 99.97% effective will let approximately 1 in every 3,333 particles past. As the efficiency of the filter goes up, so to does cost and also difficulty in moving air through it.If you're absolutely determined to measure anyway, go find a company to do indoor air quality testing. Best way to test it would be to put a bunch of whatever you're trying to filter out (pollen?) in the air (while appropriately protected) and leave the room closed up with that air purifier on. Calculate how many air changes you'll need by dividing the cubic footage of the room by the CFM of the air purifier, and leave it alone. Let's just say a day to keep things simple. Have the air tested, if the air is fine, your purifier works.Full Disclosure: I am a mold remediation foreman.  Embed Quote"

Those people certainly shouldn't have traveled here, or been outside here without proper N95 masks. Short term pollution spikes definitely can cause premature deaths -- just Google ""Great London Smog of 1952"" for the most classic example.  But having said that, there's no way to predict the May weather, which certainly could have bad days (any AQI over 200 would be reasonably bad, certainly over 300).

Beijing right now is beyond even this.  Beyond a ""Code Purple"" and beyond a ""Code Maroon""--hazardous. It's off index, or ""crazy bad"" as they called it a few years ago (long and funny story). If he alters his daily activities in the USA on Orange and Red days, he would definitely need to alter his arrangements for a trip.  Embed Quote"

In the grand scheme of things, it seems inevitable that we will see electric vehicles- at least that's what Elon says, and he says it so persuasively that I'm willing to bet that he's right.Tesla exists to accelerate that process. If it works, it'll inspire copycats and competitors, which is a good thing. That means more electric cars. The oil industry should be around for quite some time more, but they'll surely be paying attention.In the ultimate grand scheme of things, if Tesla did not exist, something else would take its place. If we're talking about electric cars, though, it seems that Tesla is at the tip of the sword. We'll see an industry begin to form around electric cars, and we'll see more and more people choosing electric cars over gasoline. Existing automobile manufacturers will feel the heat, and will start accelerating development of their own electric vehicles. It's a net good for humanity as a species.Here's the full video:(About that existential crisis, if you're curious- the question is: What impact are you going to have in the world? What's so great about you? There are so many others who are more talented, more hardworking. What can you contribute that's new, different, innovative? The answer: Possibly nothing. But you can accelerate what you believe is right and good. And that makes all the difference.)  Embed Quote"

A small-ish fraction of the world's population currently own cars, but hundreds of millions of people are rapidly rising out of poverty now in countries like India and China. The mobility and status afforded by car ownership are a primary focus for people with fresh disposable income. Most of them are going to buy cars, and if those are cars with internal combustion engines, pollution from automotive emissions, already killing millions in China and India, is going to hockey stick -- not just in urban areas and these individual countries, but in the atmosphere of the entire planet.  Electric cars pollute less overall today, and as more and more clean sources of power generation are brought online, that advantage will continue to increase considerably.Tesla has demonstrated its ability to design and build first-rate cars. The Roadster surprised automotive journalists by being an eminently capable sports car. The Model S, freshly designed from the ground up, has won 2013 Automobile of the Year Awards from virtually every source that matters, from serious car magazines like Automobile to Consumer Reports ""Best Car Ever Tested"" to the World Green Car award. It's a genuinely good-looking car, which is as critical as performance in this market segment.Tesla's financial model is working. It recently repaid its Department of Energy Loan from 2010 of nearly half a billion dollars -- nine years early. The company was technically profitable in Q1 of 2013. They've demonstrated mastery of design, supply chain, manufacturing, and marketing in a hurry.And they've done all this selling to the classes, but not yet the masses. The cars the Model S and Roadster compete against sell in the few thousands each year. Tesla's battery and drive train technology are ready to be applied to more mainstream cars that sell in the many hundreds of thousands each year. Elon Musk has demonstrated his ability to innovate and make a nickel at the same time across multiple industries. When it brings the $40,000 Model X to market in  in late 2014, Tesla's tiny current market penetration and stock price of around $100/share will both be faint memories.Innovation and disruption inspire innovation and disruption. We'll have to wait to see who the future entrepreneurs are who tell us, ""I saw what Elon and Tesla did, and I swung for the fences just like them"" -- but we know there will be a bunch of them. Tesla's impact has already been big, it's going to be huge, and it's got long legs, because human beings love, need, and use cars like few other products.  Embed Quote"

Scientists used a new technique that involved trapping airborne toxins along Los Angeles’ 110 Freeway, freezing them in water, and exposing lab mice to the toxins.The researchers used a particle sampler to collect “fresh ambient particulate matter” along the CA-110 Freeway near Los Angeles City for 30 days. After gathering grime on filters, they then soaked the filters in water for 30 minutes before freezing the water-toxin cocktail.Frozen pollutants only remain chemically stable for around 3 months, so after collecting freeway toxins, the scientists brought the toxic ice cubed back to their lab soon after. They thawed the ice and released the toxins into the air breathed by their lab mice, exposing them to the fumes for a total of 150 hours over the course of 10 weeks.The scientists then harvested the brain tissue of the mice, discovering through various cultures and tests that the mice brains resembled the brains of those suffering from memory loss or Alzheimer’s disease.

PM2.5 has become the main pollutant.According to the report published by Environment Protection Department of China, Beijing is the most polluted domestic city.

I've highlighted the actual data multiple times on my blog, including this post here: How Good are N95 Masks For Pollution?.  The key is ""N95"" or better -- this literally is a US-government certification that tested the mask and demonstrated 95% decrease (or better) in blocking particulate matter (PM) smaller than 2.5 -- or even smaller, at 0.3 microns. Europe has a different rating system. These systems started for work safety mostly in construction sites (dust, paint fumes etc) and the 3M company is the most reputable US company making these masks. This is why all the good research studies use a 3M mask as a ""gold standard"" masks. This is also why I recommend them over any other mask. By the way, we focus on PM2.5 and not gases or other toxins because it's felt that PM2.5 causes the most health problems compared to the other pollutants. A particle smaller than 2.5 microns is easily breathed in and directly absorbed into your bloodstream, starting the pro-inflammatory cascade which leads to all the bad health effects. So do N95 masks work? There are a couple studies recently which demonstrate effectiveness in wearing a mask and improving heart rate, blood pressure and also blood markers of inflammation (CRP and others). The test subjects were here in Beijing, literally walking around Second Ring Road and other areas (must have been an interesting site!). The most recent and most convincing study is here: Reducing personal exposure to partic... [Environ Health Perspect. 2012] The first study is here: Beneficial cardiovascular effects of reducing exposure to particulate air pollution with a simple facemask  This is the best evidence so far that a good mask can help decrease exposure and actually help protect your health. Hopefully, better long term studies will be more convincing. But I certainly think the evidence is sound, and it's more than logical to use a proper N95 mask anytime the air is bad. I personally recommend using a mask anytime the AQI is over 200 -- which happens all the time here. As for brands -- a great issue. On my blog I compared the two more popular brands Respro and the newer Totobobo: Respro Vs. Totobobo: Which Mask Works Better For Air Pollution? I actually prefer Totoboto because they are the only consumer version that I am aware of which has published actual real world fit-test results, showing more than 99% effectiveness against PM0.3: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubm... Respro claims 88% effectiveness but didn't provide me with the actual independent test. This is why I recommend Totobobo over Respro. As for other brands, many other new companies are claiming their material is 95-99% effective, which is great -- but what about the real world, with the mask on a face? Because air leakage and a proper fit is crucial. What good is 99% if tons of air leaks around it? This again is why I always prefer the tried and true 3M brand as the ""gold standard"", and then the Totobobo and Respro types. Don't even bother with a cotton mask or even those blue/green surgical masks, they are 30-70% effective at best.  Embed QuoteAnswered in thirty-one minutes."

Or is the Government just too incompetent to tackle this issue ?,"The HK government is aware of the problem, but air quality will not be a priority since there are more attractive diversions. It is rare to see a blue sky in HK. The HK government has not done enough to tackle the problem. Whilst a lot of taxis use LPG, there are simply too many cars on the roads. HK has an excellent public transport network, unless you live somewhere which is quite remote, then you don't need to drive. HK'ers need to get out of the status symbol mentality with cars. Whilst virtually all vehicles sold comply with the EURO standards, that doesn't help reduce pollution if your car is stuck in one of those frequent traffic jams. Some of the worst offenders are old dirty freight vehicles from mainland China. They come in their thousand every day. People often forget that some of the pollution drifts down to HK from mainland China. So no matter how much the HK government does, they can't control what big brother sends down. Then there is the lack of change in terms of how people live. Namely the reliance on air conditioning. Which uses a lot of power. I'm sure that there are innovations out there that can help, but apartment blocks seem to be built the same way for decades. However, nobody seemed to have gone the extra mile to change the thinking regarding energy saving designs. So whilst these apartment blocks look good, they are still very conservative and rather behind. More can be done here. A lot of these civil servants and government ministers don't seem to know what to do. Maybe they lack experience in handling environmental issues. However, they can always find more interesting projects to work on, such as selling land to build luxury apartment blocks to sell to wealthy mainlanders, who will spend very little time in HK. In the meantime, the native HK'er waits for an affordable apartment to become available. This is how the HK government treats the people they serve.   Embed Quote"

Or is the Government just too incompetent to tackle this issue ?,Not an easy solution. Hong Kong thrives on attracting businesses and low tax rates. Both of which in some way conflict with the idea of environmental responsibility.As an example the HK government would need to enforce and impose strict fines and taxes (carbon offsets) for businesses whom are major polluters. This is not conductive to business as it is a regulatory hurdle and politically is tough to gather support for.This article on SCMP recently underscored that HK govt did reduce pollution on power plants in conjunction with Guongdong province but saw that vehicle and ship pollution increased since then [1]. So it isn't for lack of trying. Its just that an environmental strategy needs big thinking and a political driver both of which don't exist at the moment.You can tell that big thinking isn't there by the government strategy to turn down AC in malls this year. It's a nice gesture but falls short on so many fronts. For instance how small businesses are allowed to blast AC with their storefronts open. It'd be a risky political move to ban open storefronts that waste energy like that but clearly a wider brush would help reduce energy use and pollution.And as other commenters have said these goals would need China partnership to succeed.[1] http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-ko...  Embed Quote

Since that's hard to do with pollution (who isn't an accomplice?) then the second answer is probably is it really a problem?Once a Libertarian can be convinced it's a real problem then obviously the costs need to be included in the price of all goods and services. The tricky question is how to 1) estimate the right cost to be added and 2) how to implement it worldwide. Regarding the cost: it's interesting to note estimates around what it takes to prevent a more than +2 degrees Celsius global warming (which all countries agreed upon in Copenhagen 2009)It's estimated that less than 600 Gigatons of CO2 emissions can be allowed (in the foreseeable future while earth regrow and create new carbon sinks)Interestingly there are estimates that approximately fossilfuels equivalent of 3000 Gigatons of CO2 emissions are discovered in the world (yet still untapped). Very roughly speaking this means current supply need to be capped at 600 Gigatons which in turn could be approximated with a 5 time increase in price on every ton of CO2 emissions required to produce goods and services. Regarding the implementation: political decisions has to be made to implement e.g. carbon emission trading. This is done in EU but currently the amount of allowed emissions is too high to limit emissions and therefore the price is lower than it ought to be. Ultimately a worldwide agreement needs to be in place otherwise all production will simply re-locate to whatever tiny place on earth where emissions aren't capped. The only forum for such agreements is the United Nations. I'm not sure all Libertarians have come to that conclusion yet but I personally don't see a better alternativ.  Embed Quote

An exception to this is a Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) sensor, which tests for multiple pollutants and gives you an aggregated value/level.There are devices that test for one or a few pollutants. Most air quality monitoring devices test temperature & humidity ( combined can lead to mold ), Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide. Usually for Carbon Monoxide there are standalone devices.However, this is just the tip of the iceberg, there are lots of possible and probable pollutants: Ozone, Nitrogen oxides, Sulfur Dioxide, Radon, Lead, etc. The list goes on and on and they are not as rare as one might think/hope.For example, Radon is a radioactive gas without color or smell. Radon comes from Uranium, which is present in the soil nearly everywhere in the US. It is said to be the second leading cause for lung cancer in the US.There is a lot of information and studies on the subject of indoor air quality, although much more is needed. I myself found only limited scientific studies exist for some specific pollutants.I am fascinated by this topic and I am actually currently involved in creating a monitoring device called AirPlusPlus for common indoor air pollutants. This is just the first step of a much larger vision. Hopefully one day anyone interested can monitor, track and improve the quality of the air in their homes.  Embed Quote"

There are also specific mitigation techniques that have proven effective in reducing levels of radon in the home.For pollutants other than radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health symptoms or signs of poor ventilation and specific sources or pollutants have been identified as possible causes of indoor air quality problems.

Some events that I found:One story I noticed was that Liaoning province aims to dismantle 3,805 small boilers by the end of this year (2013). A small boiler refers to the central heating system used here, similar to New York, where there are stream boilers in each district that supply heat to the local buildings. Most of these burn coal at a rate of 35 kilograms of coal, per square metre of property, during the five-month heating season. So a 100 square metre house will use 350kg of coal for heating. China burns almost as much coal each year as the rest of the world combined.I noticed the boiler behind my house here was upgraded this year. It is now noticeably quieter and seems to be eating the stock pile of coal more slowly.Another is that they are adopting the use of geothermal heat pumps to replace the heating system based on burning coal. Shenyang, capital of Liaoning province, applied the new heating method in an area of 15.28 million square meters last year. They reckon that saved them burning about 630,000 tons of coal, has reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 8,060 tons and reduced soot discharges by 5,040 tons.[1]Another big pollution source is the ever increasing number of cars on the roads. More than 13 million cars were sold in China last year (2012).  Vehicles account for 22 percent of PM2.5 in the Beijing, followed by 17 percent from coal burning and 16 percent from construction site dust. In Beijing alone, the number of vehicles has increased to 5.18 million (2012) from 3.13 million (2008).[2]Beijing and Guangzhou have already put in place rules that limit the number and use of new cars. Beijing started capping new car ownership at 20,000 a month through a lottery system in January last year. But the number of applicants reached 1.07 million in August 2012. Guangzhou recently announced a similar policy, which allows only 10,000 new cars to be registered per month. [3]In Shanghai, the government uses an auction to control the plate supply and the price has kept going up. The plate, currently worth more than 60,000 yuan (US $9,464).Nanjing and Hangzhou in east-central China are moving to require cleaner gas and diesel. Xi’an and Urumqi in north western China are banning and scrapping cars built before 2005, when automotive emissions rules were less stringent.[4]Public transport is also being improved. Already 18 cities have built subways, light rail or or other mast transit systems. Another 17 cities are building such systems at the moment and existing systems are being expanded. Yet another 24 cities are in the planning stages.[5]Power supply is another area that needs work. Most of China's electricity comes form coal power stations. At the end of 2011, wind power in China accounted for 62 gigawatts (GW) of electricity generating capacity. The country aims to have 100 gigawatts (GW) of on-grid wind power generating capacity by the end of 2015 and to generate 190 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of wind power annually. Hydropower capacity at the end of 2015 will increased to 260 GW. Also by 2015 they plan to have 10 GW of solar power capacity.[6] As part of the environmental goals included in China’s 12th Five Year Plan (2011–2015) targets have been set for non-fossil energy to account for 11.4% of the total energy consumption, and for CO2 discharge per unit of GDP to reduce by 17%.[7][1] China Daily: Liaoning to replace small heating boilers[2] National and Local Weather Forecast, Hurricane, Radar and Report: China's Love Affair with Cars Chokes City Air - weather.com[3] China Daily: China fears new car restrictions[4] NY Times: Guangzhou Moves to Limit New Cars[5] Wikipedia: Rapid transit in China[6] Reuters: China revises up 2015 renewable energy goals: report[7] Wikipedia: Wind power in the People's Republic of China  Embed Quote"

Previously, official reports only disclosed larger air particles of up to 10 microns diameter and neglected the smaller (and more hazardous) PM 2.5 particles. This resulted in the ludicrous situation of the government telling its coughing populace that the grey smog they were driving to work in was in fact an official ""blue sky day"".An impetus for the change was public outcry (mostly online) over the US embassy releasing its own hourly readings of PM 2.5 concentration through twitter (despite the censor's strong arm, netizens are still the most powerful lobby group in China). The government tried to discredit the readings by painting them as some US plot to contain China's rise. I remember one editorial in 2009 tried to suggest they were inaccurate because the embassy was too close to a major ring road. In the end, science and empirical evidence won out.  Embed Quote"

One way they could control emission is by requiring increased use/better operation of dust collection equipment (such as baghouses) in industrial settings. In the US industrial sites are required by law to meet strict emissions standards for PM2.5. The only way to meet these standards is by installing dust collection equipment throughout a facility. This technology sucks up fugitive dust emissions/dust-laden air and pushes it through a fabric filter to capture all of the dust particles before exhausting the air back into the atmosphere. This technology can take a extremely dusty operation such as cement production or steel manufacturing and reduce the dust generated  by upwards of 99%. If this type of equipment were required in China as it is in the US, (and elsewhere) they would see significant reductions in their air pollution levels.

This means that in the diesel engine the piston travels farther and compresses the inlet gas to a higher compression ratio(up to 22:1). Pressure at TDC can be found using the following formula (Picture courtesy Wikipedia):CR => Compression Ratio => Specific heat ratio of working fluid(air = 1.4)This would result in pressure at top dead center in excess of  75 bar for diesels and ~25 bar for Petrol Engines.The enthalpy of formation of NO2 gas is 33kJ/mol(which is pretty high). This means that NO2 requires high pressures at temperatures to form.Therefore even at comparable displacements more NO2 will be formed in a diesel engine as compared to a petrol.  Embed Quote

Diesel engines therefore run both hotter and at higher pressures.(For this reason, Diesel engines tend to be bigger and need to be stronger - you get a lot of Diesel powered trucks, you don't get Diesel powered motorbikes.)NOx is formed when nitrogen and oxygen from the air are combined - under heat and pressure.

The rate of any reversible reaction is the product of concentration of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants. This rate of reaction directly corresponds to the quantity of NOx in the exhaust. i.e. higher the rate of reaction, higher the quantity of pollutants. The rate of any reversible reaction is strongly influenced by the temperature at which the reaction takes place. This is also known as chemical kinetics. As we all know that in cylinder pressures in a Diesel engine is much higher when compared to a gasoline engine, the temperature is much higher too.

This was not uncommon:December 1952 in LondonIn the latter two cases, high density of pollution particulates (especially sulfur dioxide from burgeoning industrial zones in Greater London and neighboring industrial cities like Birmingham) caused significantly reduced visibility due to coal burning (driving was difficult), serious health hazards (4000 recorded deaths), and a cascade of other environmental repercussions (the peppered moth evolution comes to mind). Beijing's basin-like geography (similar to that of Los Angeles), however, is particular, and does intensify the effects of air pollution for which London has no comparison.Given this, it's still difficult to assess the levels of air pollution in China compared to other developed countries including the UK at the same point in economic development because it was nearly impossible to accurately measure air pollution such as sulfur dioxide until the 1950s, and thus we essentially have limited dependable recorded history of air pollution levels at the time when other currently developed countries were at comparable stages. In terms of runaway ecological damage, China may be in a league of its own due to a variety of factors (lack of legal transparency, complex bureaucratic barriers in implementing environmental laws, only recently growing strength of civic/grassroots movements in the Chinese Green Revolution). A really fascinating documentary I would recommend to understand the complex problems of environmental pollution in China is called the The Warriors of Qiugang (2010) by Chinese-American filmmaker Ruby Yang. It really puts things in perspective and gives you a very real picture of what sorts of environmental challenges China is facing today as a result of furious development and relentless industrialization, as well as what it means for the people living through it.  Embed Quote"

The two major mechanisms are Greenhouse gas removal and Solar radiation management. The former directly reduces the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere to decrease the heat trapped before it radiates into space. The latter reduces the solar energy absorbed by the planet, such as by producing artificial clouds to reflect light back into space.Many studies suggest that SRM would be a credible and cost-effective measure to delay global warming. (Although you can't ever stop, which is a bit scary.) If you wanted to, it could cool the planet even further than is required to offset the recent warming trend.For example, dispersing an aerosol of sulfates in the upper atmosphere has a powerful reflective effect to reduce the amount of sunlight absorbed by the planet. The effect was proven effective by the sulfur-laden eruption of Mt Pinatubo, which noticably cooled the entire planet -- so the only significant unknown is how to engineer the deployment system. Various proposals have been raised, such as adding sulfur to jet fuels, launching artillery shells into the air, and even building an enormous miles-tall pipe.Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)The cost of the ""sulfur"" plan to completely offset anthropogenic global warming has been estimated at $25-50 billion per year, which is easily within the means of a single large nation. But there are large error bars on that number -- no one's tried it yet.  Embed QuoteAnswered in twenty-five minutes."

No matter how advanced our technology gets, cooling something without heating something else up is a physical impossibility.  That heat has to go somewhere.  Yes, we could fire the heat off into space or something like that, but if that's the case, then it would be easier just to reduce the amount of heat arriving on earth in the first place (such as giant space mirror ideas)2.

Nobody is willing to fund such a massive thing.  As a species, we don't have the kind of cohesion and forward-thinking to be able to come together and do something like this for the good of ourselves and the other species on the earth.  There are also many many arguments against doing such a thing and using that money for something else, such as solving humanity's other problems; or maybe acknowledging that sooner or later something's going to wipe out humans on Earth, whether it's man-made or natural, and we'd better be making plans to be able to get off the planet and establish colonies elsewhere to ensure the survival of the human race.  Stuff like that.In summary: we can't because what you're suggesting is impossible.  We can't because what you're suggesting is too risky.  We can't because humanity doesn't have the resources, unity, or will to see through what you're suggesting  Embed QuoteAnswered in twenty-three minutes."

This is why we can't cool the atmosphere. The process of cooling requires 3 things:1) A hot ""reservoir"" to be cooled2) A cold ""reservoir"" to receive #1's heat3) In the case of standard matter, a medium in which the transfer takes placeWhen something is cooled, it is transferring molecular kinetic energy to its surroundings. The reason it does this is because of equilibrium. Everything wants to be in equilibrium with everything. It's how the universe works. So a system of hot and cold reservoirs will transfer heat until each reservoir contains equal amount of heat (or temperature). In order to cool the atmosphere, we'd need a cold reservoir for the energy to transfer to. Energy can't be destroyed, so the heat HAS to go somewhere. Well why not into space, it's cold, right? Space is void of matter. Once you leave the atmosphere, there literally is nothing. No molecules anywhere (aside from drifting bits and pieces of this and that). The medium for heat transfer doesn't exist. Nor does the cold reservoir (no molecules). Therefore we cannot cool the atmosphere with any known devices invented so far in history. How does the atmosphere get hotter/why global warming? Radiation. The sun radiates heat our way and the earth's atmosphere absorbes it. We reflect quite a bit of it, so we don't get scorched; from the sun's perspective though, we are a cold reservoir. The radiation heat is able to travel through a medium of electromagnetic waves and events. However when this heat transfers into actual matter, it must have matter as its travel medium.

The main reason for the rapid depletion over the past 30 years is because the government has encouraged China's manufacturing and industrialization, and in the process, priced water at very low rates for industry. In order to help resolve this problem, the government has proposed a major engineering project to move water from China's south, which has adequate water, to the north. In Chinese, this project is called the 南水北调工程计划. This would involve moving water through huge underground tunnels; the engineering challenges for this project are tremendous. For Beijing, the government is proposing building water desalination plants for Beijing's population. Another side effect of the industrialization policy has been topsoil erosion. With no significant plant life on the surface, and winds from Gobi desert blowing dust in every spring, desertification in north China is continuing to spread. The government has encouraged tree planting to slow the desertification, but without sufficient underground water to keep the trees alive, the problem continues.I believe the whole problem began with China's decision to turn Beijing into a mega-city. This was done for political reasons: China wanted a megacity to compete with Seoul and Tokyo. Over the past five years the Beijing city government has been rolling out new subway lines rapidly, but it is still insufficient to meet the demands of Beijing's residents.When more and more work is done by service jobs over the Internet, one needs to ask ""Is there really a need for people to be concentrated in huge cities in order to work?""Now it is paying the price.  Embed Quote"

Therefore,  I can suggest three factors that are contributing to the pollution problem that China is facing:-         Industry-         Coal-         TransportationIndustry: China has faced a rapid industrial expansion. It is now one of the main global manufacturing centers. Industry is good for the economy, but not so good for the environment. And China is one of the leading countries in some of the most polluting and energy-intensive industries, such as cement, iron and steel and mining.Coal: China burns coal to produce most of its electricity (more than 65% of its energy mix is coal-derived). Coal is relatively cheap and abundant in both China and Mongolia; however it’s one of the dirtiest ways of producing energy. And China burns a lot of it: it needs a lot of electricity for the industry and for more than 1.3 billion people. This makes the country the biggest consumer of coal in the world. Furthermore, China also uses coal to heat up water used for district-heating during winter (coincidentally winter is when most of the pollution-peaks occur) and many small houses that do not have access to district-heating systems (like those in Beijing’s Hutongs) also use coal. Just as an example, there are coal-powered thermic plants and coal-powered district-heating plants in the Beijing area.Transportation: China has had an amazing expansion of its total number of cars and flights, which undoubtedly contribute to the pollution problem, although I don’t believe they do as much as the first two factors.  Embed Quote"

However, this kind of development is contributed by countless factories which usually produce cheap and pollution oriented goods. Unlike western countries, for earning the same one dollar, china has to produce more and pollute more. In past years, GDP is the unique goal of government and air quality...no body cared.Seconds, China has the largest population in world and thus such a huge food, housing, transportation and energy demand. Each of these demands aggravates air pollution. It is noteworthy that most of power station in China is by coal, which is one of the main causes of air pollution. Another reason I think is the urbanization in China and meantime, more people become one of the middle class. If you know how many vehicles are sold in China compared to 10 years ago, you'll understand it.  Embed QuoteAnswered in fifty-four minutes."

absolutely much more harmful to smoke even 1 cigarette a day compared to living in any city in the world. You can do the math yourself, read the studies yourself: a day in Beijing is equal only to 1/6 of one cigarette. That Atlantic Cities article below was discussing an interview with me and my blog article: A Day In Beijing Is Like Smoking Only One Sixth Of A Cigarette? It's Almost...Disappointing! Here's the basics: Step 1: Read The Research People should read the scholarly article from Dr Pope, who has authored or co-authored most of the most important research on air pollution over the last 20 years. In his latest spectacularly useful research from Environmental Health Perspectives, he analyzes death rates from heart disease and lung cancers caused by smoking and air pollution. The detail is stunningly useful, and it also provided us with the data needed to actually measure mortality risk of air pollution. Step 2: Do The Math First, just what is an average day in Beijing? We get rightfully scared about these occasional 500′s, but those are rare peaks. The official average PM10 level from 2010 is 121 µg/m³, which converts to an AQI of 84, which is “Moderate” on the US EPA’s guideline. From a Steven Andrews article, we get the US Embassy’s average daily PM2.5 over the last two years of 100 µg/m³ (which converts to an AQI of 171, “Unhealthy” for the US EPA). Now we know the daily data. So how much of these particles do we breathe in a day? First, we need to know how much air an average person breathes. This can vary in the research literature, but Dr Pope mentions that most studies use an average adult inhalation of 18m³/day of air. Now we can do our calculations. If we use:PM10 data: 121 µg/m³ x 18m³/day (÷1,000 to convert µg to mg) = 2.2mg/day of inhaled PM10 PM2.5 data:  100 µg/m³ x 18m³/day (÷1,000 to convert µg to mg) = 1.8mg/day of inhaled PM2.5 Since Pope’s studies mostly use PM2.5 data for comparisons, we will focus mostly on PM2.5 and not the “official” PM10. As you can see, it’s not a stretch to use the US Embassy’s “unofficial” data, as 2.2mg and 1.8mg are relatively close numbers, in my opinion. Also, since it’s estimated that Beijing’s PM2.5 concentration is roughly 85% of PM10, then the numbers mostly are equal. Step 3: Compare To A CigarettePope also uses the research standard that an average cigarette contains 12mg of inhaled PM2.5. Yes, there are differences in smoking habits (some of us even claim “I didn’t inhale”…) but this seems to be the standard in most research literature.So if we compare the above numbers:PM2.5 data: 1.8 mg/d air pollution ÷ 12 mg cigarette = 15% of one cigarette That means that a daily dose of Beijing’s average air pollution is equivalent to 1/6 of one cigarette.  What About The Really Bad Days?So what about the really bad days when the US Embassy’s 24-hour data hits “Very Unhealthy” 200; “Hazardous” 300 or “Crazy Bad/Beyond Index” 500? Let’s find out. First, you must convert the AQI to PM2.5 concentration, which is easy to do with the online calculator:AQI200 = 150µg/m³ x 18m³/day (÷1,000) = 2.7mg/d ÷12 = 23% of one cigarette a day AQI300 = 250µg/m³ x 18m³/day (÷1,000) = 4.5mg/d ÷12 = 38% of one cigarette a dayAQI500 = 500µg/m³ x 18m³/day (÷1,000) = 9.0mg/d ÷12 = 75% of one cigarette a day This means that even with an extremely rare average of 500, that’s still equivalent to smoking less than one cigarette a day! What About Your City?What about Shanghai, or Mexico City, or LA? Just find out the average daily PM2.5 concentration or AQI and plug in the numbers! For example:City X: PM2.5 concentration =  __ µg/m³ x 18m³/day (÷1,000) = 0.27mg/d ÷12 = __ % of one cigarette a day  Embed Quote"

I'm pretty blase about it generally speaking. I know people who monitor the AQI with apps on their phones, but I don't pay it much attention. Whenever they comment on it I just shrug my shoulders and get on with things. However, Friday was something else. You know the pollution is bad when even I start talking about it and adapting my behaviour to avoid it. Usually I walk home from my nearest subway stop (about 20-25 minutes) but I took the bus this time; I didn't want to spend any meaningful time outside. I also picked up a mask on my way home (though one much less impressive than Andy Lee's) and when I got home I kept all my windows closed (I often have them open a little to air the apartment). The smog was overwhelming. Visibility was down to a hundred yards and you could taste the dust, not just in your mouth but all the way back in your throat, and it was still there the next morning. I've drunk a lot of water this weekend. It's not been pleasant.But, as I say, it's a fact of life. The cloud will move on and things will get back to normal quickly, which is to say, they will return to the normal levels of tolerable pollution. I'm also glad the Shanghai Marathon took place last weekend and not this week. They would surely have had to cancel it if it were otherwise.  Embed Quote"

I've been rather jaded about air pollution until it reached meteoric levels last week. I was waiting for the Blade Runne Blimp to silently swoop in through the haze advertising Pan Am and Koss headsets. Now I'm looking at dropping serious cash for a clean room strength air purifier for the home and the office while considering if an off-world colony is right for me. What concerns me is the short-term solution, at least in Shanghai, is to lower the benchmark for alerts during the WInter( Shanghai just lowered its air quality benchmark because that's how bad it is), which is a stark reminder that China still deploys such brazenly self-serving tactics. From what I have read, there is no long-term solution to the problem and it is likely to get worse before it gets any better.  Embed Quote"

Beijing's air quality is always in the news and it is probably a lot worse, but Shanghai's AQI has been consistently >100 since October. While 100 is not as bad as 500, I feel like this ""it could be worse"" mentality is quite unhealthy (literally). While I'm not getting on the next plane back home, it's definitely something I'm going to take into consideration when it comes to deciding whether I will stay in the longer term. People don't realize how serious the adverse health effects of air pollution are because it's not readily apparent. Beijing's lung cancer has gone up 60% in a decade despite the % of smokers remaining flat, and I wouldn't want to become part of that statistic for Shanghai in another 10 years. In the meantime, I'm stocking up on PM2.5 masks (they were completely sold out last week) and hoping I don't see another 500+ day anytime soon!  Embed Quote"

I have lived in Kunming, a city in Southwestern China famous for its ""clean air"". Indeed, Kunming regularly enjoys air significantly better than its big city eastern counterparts. However, even Kunming's air has been getting worse, due to increased automobile use and lots of construction. This is one reason why I am moving to Dali, a small town in western Yunnan Province where the air is several times better than that in Kunming, and several hundred times better than that in Beijing or Zhengzhou.  Embed Quote"

The mold toxins are free to travel throughout the body and attack every system in the body.  They can even pass through the blood/brain barrier thus causing the headaches.  There is also no way to clear the toxins if not diagnosed and properly treated.  Another cause is multiple chemical sensitivity also an inherited genetic trait.  Also the amount of chemicals in your house leach out more during times of high humidity.  This is called chemical off-gassing. There are more chemicals in your house then you think.  Consider: paints, solvents, glues, hobby stuff, cleaning products, construction products, furniture, carpeting, cigarette smoke, even the basement can have mold and or radon.  There is much more to say; But I am not a doctor just one who suffered because of both conditions that made me research.  Embed Quote"

Lets leave suffocation out of this discussion.

Back in the 1970s some shampoos were found to be contaminated with small amounts of nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic. Ethanolamine lauryl sulfates used in these shampoos were determined to be the source of the nitrosamine contamination, and manufacturers took corrective action.

One of my professors worked in the soap industry and we had lengthy conversations about chemicals found in soaps, shampoos, and detergents.  SLS and SLES are benign lathering agents with no documented general risks or adverse effects.  Both have been studied rigorously by independent agencies.  Because of the “electric” pull and the size of the molecule, it does not enter the skin and end up “in your system.”  This is true for most other ingredients in shampoo as well. SLS and SLES don’t grow on trees but they are derived from nature.  Because the process of doing so occurs in a lab, they are known as chemicals.  However, there is a difference between chemicals derived from nature and those constructed by man.  Any ingredient with a number in the name is synthetic (manmade) and in large quantities can become a health hazard.  1,4 Dioxane (synthetic chemical carcinogen) and quaternium-15 (a formaldehyde releasing preservative) are ones to watch for. In addition to synthetic chemicals (again, usually has a number in the name), watch out for “fragrance” on a product’s ingredient list.  Under FDA law, a manufacturer does not have to disclose ingredients labeled as “fragrance” to protect against knockoff perfume formulations.  Ingredients used to scent shampoos, soaps or detergents are not disclosed to any governing agency and that is where known cancer causing agents may be purposefully hidden. There are movements in the US to change the “fragrance” protection law but the US Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA) has strong lobbyists who are paid well by a 60 billion dollar industry.  The EU has banned over 1100 chemicals from personal care products because they may cause cancer, birth defects or reproductive problems.  The US has banned only 9. In the meantime, you can protect yourself by avoiding synthetic chemicals and products that contain “fragrance” on the ingredient list.  Switching brands frequently might also help to reduce continued exposure to the unlisted ingredients.  Alone, the ""natural chemicals” in shampoo, such as SLS and SLES, are not going to harm you but the fragrance might. Check out my blog.  Nurse Gail - Gail Ingram is a NYC nurse sharing her perspective on health care and wellness.  Embed Quote"

I won't duplicate that here.]Specifically as to the mouth, there are both chemical and mechanical protections. The mechanical protections, beyond tissue structure, relate to various proteins in saliva that begin the alteration and breakdown of ingested substances as well as lubricate and coat the various tissues in the mouth.Prominent in the list of proteins are mucins and amylases. As to chemical protection, one of the functions of saliva is to neutralize acids by way of three main buffering systems: carbonate, phosphate, and proteins.This buffering function is by way of protection of the downstream gastrointestinal tract, and specifically esophagus, as much as it is the mouth. While stratified squamous epithelial cells line both the mouth and the esophaugus, the mouth cells are coated with a protective protein called keratin, in addition to the protective mucous coat .By the way, What happens to stomach cells that are constantly bathed in stomach hydrochloric acid at a pH of 1-2?They are protected by mucous. Unlike the esophagus.Point of fact is that in abnormal situations where the valve function between the upper stomach and lower esophagus is not normal and ""acid reflux' happens, the cells can get damaged and change. Scarring and even cancer can result. One other note: even when cells do get damaged the body can deal with it by replacing them. This turnover rate is protective, but in certain situations not sufficient and pathology results.  Embed QuoteVia  Prarthana Bhat K."

But. That doesn't happen.So, I'm inferring that pH is not the sole criteria for corrosion.Gastric juice is corrosive because it contains hydrochloric acid, a strong ionic acid. Which dissociates RAPIDLY AND COMPLETELY in solution, producing H+ ions. Honey is made up of ORGANIC ACIDS. Chiefly gluconic acid and malic acid. Which  ionize only partially. This should also holds good for other naturally occurring food substances like tamarind ( PH can be as low as 1.8) ,yogurt ( pH is around 4) Even apples contain malic acid! But that doesn't make them corrosive.I am not a 100% confident about this answer.Let's ask Dr Gluck just to be sure :)  Embed Quote"

It lists the date of this as May 2009. The article begins by listing actual research by the American Cancer Society about the dangers of Benzene and its links to cancer. The Snopes article then provides an extract from a scientific study carried out by a South Korean university [2] that seems to refute some of the claims made in the image.A short summary of the study's findings is that it is not the dashboard of the car that emits the highest level of Benzene, but actually the fuel. In addition to this, they found that Benzene levels were higher in older cars, refuting the claim that the 'new car smell' is partly to blame. Finally, they found Benzene levels to be higher during winter, casting doubt on the claim that air conditioning elevates the level.

They can activate some of on our receptors but mostly they enter the lipid membrane around all our cells and makes it less rigid than it should be. This will interfere with normal cell functions and can be poisonous.The Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) turns ethanol into acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde is very poisonous and and gives very unpleasant side effect. The faster your ADH works, the less alcohol you need to drink before feeling unpleasant and getting hangover like symptoms. A slower working ADH gives you time to consume more alcohol and also gives you livers acetaldehyde dehydrogenase more time to removed the acetaldehyde and therefore fewer hangover symptoms. (Antabus/Disulfram works by blocking the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and so the acetaldehyde makes it uncomfortable to drink too much)If the ADH enzyme doesn't work at all, ADH won't be able to break down ethanol to acetaldehyde. Luckily we have another enzyme, CYP2E1 which can do the work, though at a slower rate.If CYP2E1 is also nonfunctional (and you're still alive somehow) the body won't be able to start metabolizing alcohol. Alcohol can be secreted through skin, lungs and be removed by intestinal bacteria, but it would most likely be too slow.Then the alcohol levels would rise so much that the mentioned cell functions would stop working and the body would go into a coma and die.  Embed Quote"

How is it possible that two obviously different molecular structures are called the same thing in the first place?2. What is the difference in terms of effects on the body?,"Inorganic arsenic refers to arsenic atoms that occur in their pure, metallic form, or in compounds where they are bonded to other non-carbon elements, such as in arsenic trichloride AsCl3.Organic arsenic refers to organic (i.e. carbon based) compounds that contain covalently bonded arsenic atoms. One example of this is 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenearsonic acid:Believe it or not, this compound was marketed by Pfizer under the brand name of Roxarsone for use as a chicken feed supplement in the US. That is, until the FDA cried foul and outlawed it. Now you may wonder, how was feeding this to chickens possible in the first place, if arsenic is such a vicious poison? Well, the toxicity of the arsenic atom stems from how it chemically disrupts the complex sequence of metabolic reactions in the body that ultimately provides energy in the form of ATP. However, when the arsenic atom is already bonded to other functional groups, as in this example compound, it cannot react in the same way. For that reason, most organoarsenic compounds are far from as acutely toxic as the pure metal.[1] Commonly, the toxicity of many organoarsenic compounds actually stems from how the body can detoxify it back to inorganic arsenic, which is what the FDA was worried about. Still, it is a good idea to steer clear of all arsenic compounds in general as they tend to be toxic in one form or another._____________[1] http://www.medterms.com/script/m...  Embed Quote"

However if the Aluminium is in the form of a dust or powder which is of small enough particle size to become airborne it's not so great. In the UK the HSE (Health and Safety Executive) have a document called EH40, which was last updated in 2007 (and is due to be replaced when REACH kicks in), and Aluminium is given a WEL or Workplace Exposure Limit, of 10mg/m3 for inhalable dust and 4 mg/m3 for respirable dust. This means that the concentration of Aluminium dust in the air should never exceed 10mg of dust per m3 of air in the working environment. As such the danger is inhaling the metal dust in the air, and for info inhalable dust is dust with a particle size such that you can inhale it, but it is not small enough to get into your bloodstream. Respirable dust however is somewhat finer/smaller and once inhaled into your lungs can be absorbed into the bloodstream, and as such is far more dangerous.I'm not trying to worry you here, as in most conditions you don't need to worry about it, but if you are working in an environment which exposes you or your colleagues to Aluminium dust or Aluminium fumes (from melting Al or working with molten Al), then you need to look into this further. Normally some sort of extraction system would help, and as a last resort workers can wear face masks with P3 filters that will filter out fine particulates down to about 5microns - Hope that helps.  Embed Quote"

What Does It Feel Like?Mercury in all of its forms is a rather strong neurotoxin [5] although methylmercury and inorganic Mercury have a more powerful impact to animals. Neurotoxins inhibit neuron control over ion concentrations via the cell membrane or via communication between neurons across the nerve synapse. The impact it may have is based on the quantity, term and situation of the exposure.  Thus how this may feel will be directly translated by the exposure(s) and duration. If a threshold is reached on either level the symptoms may become irreversible. Early StagesIn the very early stages of Mercury poisoning there are usually no obvious symptoms.  Most simple aches, pains and itches would be discounted.  Most would also ignore the “mental fog” and temporary insomnia.  One may note a decline in the resistance to catching colds and flus but the impact to the immune system would not be quite pronounced.These early stages would give way to itching, burning and then perhaps pain in the extremities, known as peripheral neuropathy [6]. Mercury poisoning at this stage is often not easily diagnosed as it can mimic other diseases and temporary aliments.  The symptoms will move on to the more obvious where skin turns to a pronounced pink to red color along with perhaps some swelling and skin shedding called desquamation.  At this stage in our epoch one may think they need to visit a Demonologist. Medium StagesIn medium stages the victim of Mercury poisoning will began to have a shutter or swing to the movement of limbs that may give way to a more pronounced involuntary and continuous shake.  One would note an increase in salvation almost to the point of drooling and perfuse sweating.  The victims immune system would also be compromised and there would be nearly constant colds and flu-like symptoms.  At this point the impact to the brain will become very pronounced and would result in a number of notable markers:IrritabilityShyness or TimidityAnxiety and/or nervousness Exaggerated response to stimulationEmotional instability Loss of self confidenceIndecisionLoss of memoryInability to concentrateLethargyInsomniaDepressionDespondencyWithdrawalSuicidal tendenciesIn this stage one would very well become the very definition of what it feels like to go insane.  There would still be a great deal of normal memory and thought processes but mixed with profound withdrawal from just about all normal activities. This is the stage that many Mad Hatters were identified.  In Carroll’s Alice his Mad Hatter was more an extrovert and perhaps this was a useful literary tool or perhaps in some cases he observed there was more “madness” and less withdrawal.In most cases the withdrawal is so profound that the afflicted person would not seem to want or seek help and may have lost all ties to friends and family. In some cases misdiagnoses can happen and consequently Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease), dementia, and multiple sclerosis may be attributed to the cause of the symptoms. End StagesIn the end stages of Mercury poisoning a complete breakdown of vital organ functions would begin.  The victim would have slowly lost most memory and the shakes would have become vigorous.  The heart, lungs and liver would begin to fail and death would result at this point.Living As A Mad HatterMedical treatment is indicated at any exposure to Mercury under any and all circumstances but most especially in children.  There are a number of tests and protocols that could impact the progression of the poisoning.  It would be of paramount importance that if it is known that there was exposure to Mercury that this should be shared with the Doctor.If the primary exposure to Mercury has stopped, the impact would remain unless otherwise treated and in some cases reversed. The transition through the early stages where the impact could be assumed to be anything to the early medium stages, one could live what appears to be a normal life if there is no more exposures to Mercury and no Chelation [7] therapy to reduce or eliminate the toxin. It is noted in the literature and newspaper accounts from the 1700s through the early 1920s that victims of what is now known as Mercury poisoning lived just perhaps less then a normal lifespan and in many cases continued on with personal and professional life.  But clearly with the notable side effects mentioned.If you survived a medium stage Mercury poisoning the world would have transitioned over time to a very lonely and dark place.  You will feel like a grade B horror movie where you are the central character and the world would seem to look on in horror.________[1] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland[2] Hatmaking[3] Felt[4] Mercury(II) nitrate[5] Neurotoxin[6] Peripheral neuropathy[7] Chelation  Embed Quote"

I weigh about 65 kilos, so to reach the amount of EtOH that would probably kill me, I'd need to consume a little less than 700 grams of alcohol to kill me. Given the density of ethanol at room temperature and sea level (0.786 g/ml), that's about 540 ml of ethanol. Drinking PBR at about 5% alcohol by volume (2), I would need to drink almost 3.5 gallons to kill myself. Not going to happen, which is why it's so much safer to shotgun beer than do shots. Stay safe, kids.But everything changes if instead of drinking PBR, I inhale alcohol. Such a mistake can be made by well-meaning people trying to, say, make jello shots. To make jello shots, one should mix alcohol and water and chill the mixture. When adding hot liquid to dissolve the jello mix, only boiling water should be used, and the alcohol added later (3).This seemingly convoluted way of producing jello shots, instead of mixing alcohol and water and heating the mixture, is done just so for the reason that the crazy party you wish to throw will be much less cool if you die before it starts. While we could do some decent estimation for a vapor-liquid equilibrium of an ethanol-water system while varying temperature and mole fractions using Raolt's Law or be more specific by examining the azeotrope of ethanol and water, I'm writing this on an iPad at the moment. An engineering student doing calculations without Excel is like writing with a broken pencil: it's pointless (heh, heh).Suffice it to say that, since ethanol is more volatile than water, if we have a closed system (like a pot on the stove with a lid on it) and heat it, the resulting vapor will have a lot more ethanol in it than water. If one inhales that vapor, as one might do when pulling the lid off the pot and breathing deeply, one breath of 70+% ethanol vapor is quite enough to exceed the CDC's IDLH limit (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health), which is a measly 15,000 ppm, or the lethal inhaled dose, which is somewhere above 20,000 ppm for long exposures, or above 2% (4).However, while inhaling a very concentrated ethanol vapor could certainly kill someone, the total amount of ethanol required wouldn't be all that high, and certainly not much more than a determined soul at an end-of-the-semester party could consume.

Not if you drink it, not if you draw on your body...Inks sold in stores have to undergo testing and certification. If it's labeled non toxic, it's exactly that. (Parents often ask me this when their child has eaten a Crayola marker, etc.) All children's art supplies MUST undergo strict tests for lead, hazardous materials, etc. The US government is very rigid about children's products (regulated by the CPSIA) and will ask companies to provide samples frequently and at random to ensure manufacturing guidelines have been followed consistently. In addition, certain pigments are certified for food, others for cosmetics, etc---so these things are pretty well documented as far as toxicity. For example, inks and pigments for eye make up are not necessarily allowed to be used in lipstick or markers.  If it's a homemade ink (like from walnuts) you might have some problems if it isn't preserved well (bacteria and mold---or alcohol poisoning if there's an alcohol base) or there is a nut allergy in the house. Inks meant to be permanent usually have chemicals in them that are toxic (which is why they aren't for kids) and their labels will not have the non-toxic markings on them. The toxicity in these usually comes from the solvents or chemicals used to disperse the ink pigments and to retain an ink's fluidity. Inks for clothing are usually toxic until they are set--at which point (in particular in children's clothing) the dried inks are supposed to be tested for toxic content before the item is sold. So in their liquid form they might be toxic but once they are cured, their chemical composition changes and are no longer toxic. Either way, none of it is meant to be consumed in large amounts. Just like you really aren't encouraged to eat the logo off your t-shirt...One last thing--The pigments old artists used to use (like Van Gogh) often WERE toxic---as were the inks. These, of course, were proprietary blends with formulations known only to the artist and a few of his/her assistants. These types of inks and pigments were usually made even more toxic by the addition of solvents and chemicals. These are generally not the kinds of inks you will find at a store---at least, I have never encountered them. Although, I wouldn't recommend licking an old manuscript, etc. Often these inks contained salts and metals (like lead). Old children's books (leaded printing ink was banned in '78) also often contain this metal in debatable quantities.  Embed Quote"

Anonymous made me realize the Swiss could have really measured a significant abnormality, yet to repeat the words of Darcy Christen, spokesman for Lausanne’s Institute of Radiation Physics:Clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether the Palestinian leader was poisoned or not.He was cooperative to the peace process at that point and was actually an asset to it, I believe this was seen as such by all sides: The father of the hope for a nation for the Palestinians, a way less radical and more open to debate politician on the US/Israeli side (cf. Camp David etc.), making the scenario less credible.He was already in the late stages of Parkinson's Disease and his days as an active politician were counted. The move would make no sense.My own medical take on the Polonium: it would have made Arafat die a slow, painful death, like Alexander Litvinenko. It would have not killed him invisibly, nor as quickly as whatever did in reality. Even at megadoses, radiation poisoning is something the expert doctors that treated him in Paris must have had recognized.In the end-stages of Polonium poisoning he would look like Litvinenko in his last days:I doubt that this would have go unnoticed and kept quiet for 8 years.  Embed Quote"

However, based on the multiple tests, the answer is: almost certainly not.Five reports are available: Arafat died in a French hospital, and at the time they concluded he died of natural causes. He was rather sick at the time, as to be expected given his advanced age. An autopsy was not performed at the request of his widow, Suha Arafat.Two weeks afterwards, his nephew and UN Observer Nasser al-Kidwa was unable to find cause of death based on a review of the medical records, but did state a tox screen performed had no traces of any known poison. The medical records are owned by the Palestinians, who have refused to publish them.Eight years after his death (way too long for a decent autopsy or radiation test), Arafat's widow ordered his body exhumed and samples sent to three independent labs around the world.  The results:The Swiss lab said they found traces of polonium, but did not go so far as to say he was poisoned, saying the study was ""inconclusive."" The Russian lab leaked that they found no traces of polonium at all and that he could not have been poisoned, though they quickly tried to cover up that leak.Most recently, the French lab declared they were unable to find any polonium and formally concluded the cause of death was natural causes.Let's convert those inconclusives to conclusives. We have 4/5 reports stating there was no evidence of poisoning and no traces of polonium on the body. Furthermore, the one study that did find polonium could not determine whether Arafat was poisoned or whether or not the samples were deliberately tainted. Add to that Suha Arafat's mysterious motives: why wait so long to run studies? Why did she prevent the autopsy in the first place? You won't see this in Western media, but among Palestinians Suha's actions are seen as unusual and she is a controversial figure. In other words though we will never know for sure, the evidence suggests he died of natural causes.To answer your subquestions, Arafat had a lot of enemies… mostly internal. The foreign tests were funded by al Jazeera, who were trying to prove  Israel poisoned Arafat. However, according to the more liberal al Arabiya, most Palestinians close to Arafat agree  that, if he was murdered, it was by political rivals. Suha herself suspects he was killed by other Palestinians: if not Hamas then by others in his own party trying to usurp his power (Hence why so many in the PLO leadership are wary of her). To date Suha has never mentioned Israel or cast any suspicion on them for the assassination; rather, she feels it was an inside job. Since the tests could never show who was responsible anyway, most actual Palestinians believe they are a waste of time at best and a desecration of his body at worst.

A control from another man's underwear registered 6.7mBq.Most of the Polonium, 60%-80% came from unnatural sources.The amount of Polonium is simply too high (it is very, VERY high) to conclude anything other than he was poisoned by Polonium 210. Simply by Occam's Razor, we would have to conclude it was the most likely cause of his death at this point. This may change as his body is tested.The main assumption that I'm making, of course, is that the materials tested had not been contaminated (deliberately or otherwise) after his death. This will be confirmed by testing his body.As for who, that is speculation. I would need to be convinced that Israel was behind it, but it's a pretty high-tech mode of assassination, so a suspicious glance must be thrown their way.With more time, and a review of the science, I've put some more coherent thoughts together:http://www.avrammeitner.com/2012...  Embed Quote"

Tobacco smoke is a mixture of gases and particles. It contains more than 7,000 chemical compounds. More than 250 of these chemicals are known to be harmful, and at least 69 are known to cause cancer.In toxicology we have something called DOSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP. The effects of exposure to poisons vary with the amount of exposure, which is another way of saying ""the dose."" Usually when we think of dose, we think in terms of taking one vitamin capsule a day or two spoons of syrup every four hours, or something like that. If you take to your hand any medicine you will see there are different doses for kids and adults. Why? Because kids are lighter and the dose is related to the mass of organism. the bigger mass of organism the bigger dose it needs to get some therapeutic effect.In the case of inhalative exposure dose is the resultant of: -weight of organism-concentrations of substances in the air,-time of exposure,-and frequency of exposure.If we have dog (body mass 35kg) and man (body mass 70kg) locked in the room in the same time with the same frequency of exposure, where somebody is smoking or has been smoking recently, the dog will be more affected by the smoke then the man, becouse of smaller body weight. Lets say they both absorbe 70mg of toxins. The dog will absorb 2mg per kilo of his body mass (70mg/35kg) and the man 1mg per kilo.Secondhand smoke (SHS) is classified as a “known human carcinogen” (cancer-causing agent) by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US National Toxicology Program, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC – a branch of the World Health Organization). So yes, the dogs with owners who smoke are more likely to suffer from cancer than other dogs, becouse they are exposed for cancerogenic secondhand smoke.In dogs, second-hand smoke has been found to be greatly associated with nasal sinus cancer and also linked with lung cancer. A study conducted at the State of Colorado reveals that there is a higher incidence of nasal cavity tumors in dogs that were exposed to ETS as compared to dogs that live in households with non-smoking members. This conclusion was particularly found amongst breeds with long noses such as Collies. There were no significant nasal tumors amongst dogs with short to medium noses exposed to second-hand smoke.Experts indicate that long-nosed breeds are more at risk because their nasal passages consist of greater surface area on which the carcinogens can be deposited before it reaches the lungs. Also, they pointed out that because their nasal passages have more cells, there is a greater chance that some of these cells get mutated by carcinogens into cancer cells.The same study mentioned that despite the fact that dogs with short to medium noses exposed to ETS do not have a great nasal tumor risk as compared to those unexposed, they, nonetheless, have a slightly greater incidence of lung cancer. This is likely because their shorter nasal passages tend to be less effective at filtering the said carcinogens out of breathed-in air before it enters the lungs. Unlike human beings who can develop bladder cancer as a result of second-hand smoke exposure, dogs generally do not run a higher risk of bladder cancer when exposed to these harmful elements.As a pet owners’ bond with their four-legged companions become stronger, they share more of their lives, their leisure time and their living space with their pets, thereby exposing them to the same environmental hazards that they do. Many human habits, including smoking, can affect animals just as they can affect the other members of the household. By designating a separate room in the house or smoking only outside, you can minimize exposure for your pooch as well as the other non-smoking members of the family.Literature:Page on dogingtonpost.comSmoking And Your DogSecondhand Smoke  Embed Quote"

Methylphenidate (the chemical name for Ritalin), on the other hand, enhances the activity of the transporter. And this difference is actually what makes amphetamine neurotoxic and methylphenidate comparatively benign. The thing is, dopamine is a very reactive molecule when it isn't packaged by VMAT-2, and when it autooxidizes in the presynaptic cytosol, it can actually damage the presynaptic terminal. Amphetamine accelerates this, and causes presynaptic terminal damage. Meanwhile, methylphenidate prevents it from happening. Surprisingly enough, this produces interesting results, which led to this paper: http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/co.... Basically, that paper shows that methylphenidate actually attenuated the deficits associated with damage induced by methamphetamine (methamphetamine does all the damage of amphetamine , but adds A LOT to that damage). So surprisingly enough, methylphenidate actually can attenuate the neurotoxicity associated with amphetamine, if taken along with it. Keep in mind, though, that methylphenidate has a shorter half-life than amphetamine.Some of dopamine's neurotoxicity is actually caused by monoamine oxidase A (MAO) in the presynaptic terminal. When MAO catalyzes the degradation of dopamine, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced as a result, and this H2O2 can go on to damage the presynaptic terminal. Methylphenidate effectively reduces the amount of MAO degradation of dopamine in the presynaptic terminal by blocking dopamine reuptake - this reduces the amount of H2O2 released. Has amphetamine's neurotoxicity (relative to methylphenidate) been experimentally demonstrated? Here's one of the papers (http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/co...As the use of amphetamine in the treatment of ADHD has increased, a large body of preclinical data has accrued indicating that amphetamine has the potential to damage brain dopamine-containing neurons in experimental animals. In particular, animals treated with amphetamine develop lasting reductions in striatal dopamine, its major metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), its rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, its membrane transporter (DAT), and its vesicular transporter (VMAT2) (Gibb et al., 1994; McCann and Ricaurte, 2004). Anatomic studies indicate that lasting dopaminergic deficits after amphetamine are due to damage of dopaminergic nerve endings in the striatum, with sparing of dopaminergic nerve cell bodies in the substantia nigra.In particular, the results of the present study indicate that an oral regimen of amphetamine, modeled after dosing regimens used in patients with ADHD, engenders plasma amphetamine concentrations that result in toxicity to brain dopaminergic axon terminals in baboons and squirrel monkeys. These results may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of ADHD and raise the question of whether or not plasma monitoring might be indicated in ADHD patients receiving higher, chronic doses of amphetamine.Anyways, here's another very good thread discussing this theme:http://www.longecity.org/forum/t...And a very comprehensive lit review article (discusses what I said here + more): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/...That all being said, amphetamine's effects are not universally bad. It can increase neurogenesis, perhaps because many individuals with ADD are so distracted that their distraction effectively inhibits neural pathways from forming. Amphetamine/methylphenidate can help promote the formation of these neural pathways by reducing this noise. See below:http://jad.sagepub.com/content/1...In early studies, high doses of amphetamine, comparable to amounts used by addicts, were shown to damage dopaminergic pathways. More recent studies, using therapeutic regimens, appear contradictory. One paradigm shows significant decreases in striatal dopamine and transporter density after oral administration of “therapeutic” doses in primates. Another shows morphological evidence of “trophic” dendritic growth in the brains of adult and juvenile rats given systemic injections mimicking “therapeutic” treatment. Imaging studies of ADHD-diagnosed individuals show an increase in striatal dopamine transporter availability that may be reduced by methylphenidate treatmentAnd from the mentioned lit review (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/...In contrast to concerns about potential adverse effects of amphetamine on the brain during aging, it is remarkable that the reduction of the heightened risk for substance abuse that is otherwise associated with ADHD by the initiation of stimulant treatment during childhood appears to be accompanied by a congruent reduction in structural brain pathology. Unmedicated children with ADHD had smaller brain white matter volume than medicated children with ADHD (−8.9%, P<.001) or children without ADHD (−10.7%, P<.001), suggesting that early stimulant treatment may normalize brain white matter volume in ADHD 182.The mentioned lit review also says that amphetamine appears to be less neurotoxic in younger primates, as compared to older primates. With that being said, there is one study that says that high doses of amphetamine in adolescence can impair adult working memory: http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele.... With that said, the study was done in rats that didn't even have ADD, so it may not be that applicable. But it is still something that may merit consideration.==Recent update (press release article after my original post): In fact, one end result of dopamine neurotoxicity is Parkinson's - the risk of which is increased among methamphetamine users - see http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele.... However, meth users destroy *far* more dopamine neurons than any person on Adderall could ever do (meth is far more neurotoxic than amphetamine, and the doses are usually far higher), so I don't think Adderall users need to fear a significantly higher risk of Parkinson's.One study suggests a possible effect at ADD-related doses too (not too rigorous of a study, but it is suggestive):http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele...The study involved 66,348 people in northern California who had participated in the Multiphasic Health Checkup Cohort Exam between 1964 and 1973 and were evaluated again in 1995. The average age of the participants at the start of the study was 36 years old. Of the participants, 1,154 people had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease by the end of the study.Exposure to amphetamines was determined by two questions: one on the use of drugs for weight loss and a second question on whether people often used Benzedrine or Dexedrine. Amphetamines were among the drugs commonly used for weight loss when this information was collected.According to the study, those people who reported using Benzedrine or Dexedrine were nearly 60 percent more likely to develop Parkinson's than those people who didn't take the drugs. There was no increased risk found for those people who used drugs for weight loss.  Embed Quote"

Some of the subjective effects that are possibly of concern are effects on your personality and sense of self. It is hard to explain, but you can end up with a feeling that you are sort of just ""observing"" yourself live your life, you are not actually experiencing it. You can find yourself being extremely productive and doing everything right, but somehow it feels like someone else did it, you were just along for the ride. It can be a good idea to take a break from the drugs from time to time to get your bearings and make sure you are in touch with yourself.   Embed Quote"

After talking with other ADHD people, their effects and side effects are a bit of a crap shoot; roughly half of those I spoke with had minimal-to-no side effects. For me, they were only marginally effective and the Ritalin caused a long-term neural side effect that comes and goes despite ceasing the drug many months ago. Overall, if they help but have side effects, you have to carefully weigh the potential long-term negatives and closely monitor your symptoms. Most all are cataloged in the drug interaction and warning sheets given with the drugs; it is advisable to also research them on the web. There are two alternatives that I am aware of that are non-amphetamine medications; Intuniv and Strattera. Intuniv was marginally helpful to me and it was obvious that a dose capable of being sufficiently efficacious to help me was going to be more than I could handle due to side effects. Strattera was a wonder drug for me, but my prostate enlarged drastically, and I consider that a very cruel outcome.Any of the meds that can cause brain function changes significant enough to quell ADHD symptoms (depending on the severity of your symptoms) are indeed profound medications and need to be carefully monitored. The long-term use of any amphetamine-based product has shown to be somewhat-to-very deleterious over the life of the user. As someone once said, ""You might see old junkies, but you never see an old speed freak."" Beyond that, the psychoactve and behvioral changes these drugs bring on are more insidious than the physical ones and, in some cases, can become permanent — a small percentage, granted, but who knows who it will be? As with anything in life, those changes that you can effect without introducing foreign substances into your body have the best chance of making real changes vs. the temporary effects afforded by a drug. Learning to meditate (which is a huge accomplishment for most with ADD/ADHD) is major, as are learning organizational methods, dietary changes, exercise and other things. Yes, a pill is easier, but only in one sense in that the effects are temporary and the side effects can be permanent. ADHD is a bitch, pure and simple, otherwise it wouldn't be listed as a covered condition in the Americans with Disabilities Act. Still, as with any disability, there are myriad coping and conditioning methods that should be attempted in earnest, and pills should be the last resort.Thanks to Alex Chen for his thorough article.

is a companion question to What common harmless foods are poisonous in large quantities? Answers to this question should not include foodstuffs that are lethal.,"The Cinnamon challenge is a challenge to eat a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon almost no one can do it. You will cough gag and burn your mouth and throat first. You could choke and inhale the cinnamon and asphyxiate yourself.Doing the same thing with Nutmeg will likely kill you due to natural toxins in Nutmeg in small quantities.  Eating just 0.2 ounces of it can leave you convulsing and eating 0.3 ounces will lead to hallucinations. Feeling brave? Or maybe you have a death wish? Eating a whole one will leave you in a state of “nutmeg psychosis” and with the sense of an impeding doom.Too much salt mixed in anything will cause instant vomiting.Each bitter (unheated) almond contains 4-9 mg of hydrogen cyanide. If not heated properly in cooking then the danger still looms. The severity of their risk is enough for the USA to limit the sale of their raw variety. Unroasted (bitter) almonds mixed in anything unheated can kill you.Tomatoes Despite the extreme popularity of tomatoes and many countries, it is true that they are poisonous. Though the fruit itself doesn’t contain poison, the stem as well as the leaves contain a chemical known as glycoalkaloid. Higher levels are said to be found in wild tomatoes, but those grown domestically still contain glycoalkaloid. This chemical is known to cause upset stomachs and nervousness. This chemical is so powerful that it is actually used as a way to control pests.Cherries are definitely one of the most versatile fruits. You can eat them raw, cook them, bake them, and get them tart or sweet. Cherries can even be used in certain types of liquor. Despite their overall red goodness, cherries are toxic. If you’ve ever eaten a cherry and without thought chewed on the pip or left it in your mouth, you more than likely introduced hydrogen cyanide into your body. If a cherry pip is chewed, crushed, or somehow damaged, it automatically produces hydrogen cyanide. Symptoms of mild poisoning include headache, dizziness, confusion, anxiety, and vomiting. Larger doses can lead to difficulty breathing, increased blood pressure and heart rate, and kidney failure. Reactions can include coma, convulsions, and death from respiratory arrest.Potatoes. Potatoes contain glycoalkaloids (solanine and chaconine), toxic compounds which are more prevalent in the wild potato varieties. Cooking at high temperatures mostly removes the toxin, although headaches, diarrhea, and cramps—and in severe cases, coma and death—can occur in rare cases. Ever wonder why we’re told to keep potatoes away from light? It’s to prevent higher concentrations of solanine. So don’t eat potatoes after they have turned green.Apricot Stones (Seeds). Actually, many fruits of the rose family contain cyanogenetic glycosides, which upon ingestion release hydrogen cyanide gas. These include seeds from cherries, apples, plums, almonds, and peaches. Although it would take a mega-dose to do you in, keep this in mind the next time you go on an apricot seed binge. There have been reported deaths in Turkey, a large apricot grower, for this very reason.Chocolate. Chocolate contains the alkaloid theobromine, which in unusually high doses can be toxic to humans. However, it would take an unholy amount of chocolate to achieve this. But other species react much worse: dogs, parrots, horses, and cats can be killed by ingesting chocolateTapioca. Tapioca, if not processed properly, can be toxic. It contains a natural source of cyanide, whose precursor, linamarin, is rendered harmless if properly dried, soaked, and baked.The Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica and features in its cuisine. When picked before it is fully ripe, the fruit contains a chemical that limits the body’s ability to release the backup supply of glucose that is stored in the liver. That supply is essential because once the body uses up the sugar immediately available in the bloodstream, an event that usually occurs several hours after eating, it depends on this glucose to keep blood sugar levels normal until the next meal. Without it, blood sugar plunges dangerously. Enough people have died from eating unripened ackee to make it illegal to bring the raw fruit into the U.S although that restriction doesn’t apply to canned and properly processed ackee.Hot Dogs They're much more than a tailgating staple. In a new paper, the American Academy of Pediatrics says hot dogs are also a choking hazard to children and should come with a warning label. About 17% of food-related asphyxiations in those younger than 10 are caused by hot dogs, according to a 41-state study cited in the paper. The Academy even recommended that hot dogs be redesigned to make it less likely that they will get lodged in the throats of the young.Water! Water intoxication, also known as water poisoning, is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain functions that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside of safe limits (e.g., hyponatremia) by overhydration, i.e., over-consumption of water.  ^ At the onset of this condition, fluid outside the cells has an excessively low amount of solutes (such assodium (hyponatremia) and other electrolytes) in comparison to that inside the cells causing the fluid to shift through (via osmosis) into the cells to balance its concentration. This causes the cells to swell. In the brain, this swelling increases intracranial pressure (ICP). It is this increase in pressure which leads to the first observable symptoms of water intoxication: headache, personality changes, changes in behavior, confusion, irritability, and drowsiness. These are sometimes followed by difficulty breathing during exertion, muscle weakness, twitching, or cramping, nausea, vomiting, thirst, and a dulled ability to perceive and interpret sensory information. As the condition persists papillary and vital signs may result including bradycardia and widened pulse pressure. The cells in the brain may swell to the point where blood flow is interrupted resulting in cerebral edema. Swollen brain cells may also apply pressure to the brain stem causing central nervous system dysfunction. Both cerebral edema and interference with the central nervous system are dangerous and could result in seizures, brain damage, coma or death. On January 12, 2007, Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old woman and a mother of 3, from Rancho Cordova, California, was found dead in her home by her mother, hours after trying to win one of Nintendo's Wiigame consoles. KDND 107.9 ""The End"" radio station's ""Hold Your Wee for a Wii"" contest, involved drinking large quantities of water without urinating. A nurse called the radio station to warn them about the danger in which they were putting people, but the disc jockeys were less than impressed. Lucy Davidson, the winner of the contest, was severely sickened while picking up her prize. Civil charges against the radio station were filed by Jennifer's family, and the family was eventually awarded $16.5 million in the ensuing wrongful death lawsuit.  Embed QuoteAnswered in twenty-three minutes via  Kat Tanaka Okopnik."

Anyways from my experience of cooking Pakistani food which can easily be bracketed in Indian food, excessive salt and red chili powder can cause severe damage to your health. Apart from that any aromatic spices like nutmeg ,mace , cinnamon , star anise, cloves can cause discomfort when used excessively.  Embed Quote"

Most maggots probably would be killed by stomach acid. There are some, however, that can survive it and prove a danger to health.In fact, one of these maggots is intentionally introduced into food (it's not from Africa, but it's entirely possible that some African maggots could do it too)What the hell is it? This, dear reader, is a medium-sized lump of Sweet Fucking Christ. Casu Marzu is a sheep' milk cheese that has been deliberately infested by a Piophila casei, the ""cheese fly."" The result is a maggot-ridden, weeping stink bomb in an advanced state of decomposition.Its translucent larvae are able to jump about 6 inches into the air, making this the only cheese that requires eye protection while eating. The taste is strong enough to burn the tongue, and the larvae themselves pass through the stomach undigested, sometimes surviving long enough to breed in the intestine, where they attempt to bore through the walls, causing vomiting and bloody diarrhea.Read more: The 6 Most Terrifying Foods in the World | Cracked.com http://www.cracked.com/article_1...  Embed Quote"

PMMA/ MMA  is referenced to be toxic when used in plastic nails and as liquid monomer glue for cosmetic nails such that the FDA recommends using ethyl methacrylate ?nails & monomer glues for health reasons. Most of the published research does not examine exposures to MMA / PMMA ( acrylic and laser fracture byproducts ) from using a laser cutter with typically poor to negligible exhaust ( as by hobbiests ). The volumetric amounts of MMA released from cutting lots of acrylic sheets for prototype fabrication far exceeds the amounts in bone surgery / repair - hugely. To some many folks it will have inconsequential effects until some indeterminate cumulative exposure or complications with other health problems, after which who knows? What is different versus solvents, is how plastic monomer vapors will accumulate in the lungs and digestive tract, seemingly insolubilized  and how vapors formed by ablating cutting solids will be far larger in net dosing than vapors from exhausted solvents.  Embed Quote"

The radioactive seawater concentration from leaking/dumped coolant long ago dropped below the detectability threshold somewhere in the mid Pacific due to dilution and half-life decay. Note that our ability to detect radioisotopes in the environment is exceptionally sensitive due to decades of military funding of a global network of land- and satellite-based sensors, intended to identify nuclear weapon tests (for enforcing the Comprehensive Test Ban and Non-Proliferation Treaties). We can detect a faint whiff of xenon released by a sub-kiloton underground detonation halfway around the planet. It's crazy how little radiation it takes to set off the detectors. So when I say ""barely detectable"" or ""below the threshold"" you should take that as a truly minuscule amount of radiation. In comparison, the radioactive material in the atmosphere from the airburst nuclear weapons tests from 1945-1980 is still quite detectable, and every living creature on Earth is exposed to it. And there has been no statistically-measurable health impact to the public from that in the past 50 years. Any health impacts have been so minimal as to be indistinguishable from normal cancer rates. There's no reason for anyone in the US to worry about Fukushima, and there never was. The stress and fear (eg taking unnecessary iodine pills) definitely caused more harm than the meltdown did.For more information on the health impacts of radiation, I highly recommend spending some time reading this comprehensive article:http://world-nuclear.org/info/Sa...  Embed Quote"

Fukushima is a long way from over, and the information we've gotten from TEPCO and the Japanese and American governments is both extremely patchy and thoroughly distorted. That's what governments and interested / liable parties do by default: withhold and bend information. TEPCO and the government of Japan have told an endless series of lies about how much radiation has been released, where it has gone, and what the acceptable limits of exposure are (the Japanese government simply revises acceptable limits of exposure upward every time they're caught in a fresh lie about what people have actually been exposed to, sometimes by as much as 20x). Stanford scientists have established that there isn't a tuna swimming in the Pacific today that isn't carrying radiation from Fukushima. Other scientists attempting to conduct intelligent risk assessment have frankly stated, There is a dearth of publicly available data, or at least little data known to us, regarding the levels of radioactive contamination in the sea and in seafood as a consequence of these chronic leaks of radioactivity into the sea from Fukushima. (Dr. Thomas Cochran)The health effects of Fukushima radiation -- airborne, waterborne, bio-accumulated in fish, are not yet known, and not yet knowable. As Ryan Carlyle himself writes in an answer dismissing the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, ""Radioactive fallout is mutagenic and sticks around for decades."" The patient person can begin to learn more about the reality of long-term effects of radioactive fallout by watching something like ""Medical and Ecological Consequences of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident"":I'm a huge fan of Ryan Carlyle's learned and well-written answers here on oil exploration. The trouble I have with Ryan Carlyle's answer to this question is the same as my trouble with Ryan Carlyle's answer to Fukushima Prefecture: Is Fukushima radiactive leaking going to effect on the health of people living in Tokyo? and Ryan Carlyle's answer to Fukushima Dai-ichi Reactors: How many people have died or will die from radiation from the Fukushima accident? and Ryan Carlyle's answer to Travel: I am going to Japan in August 2013. Will it be safe from leaking radioactive material to swim in water in the Izu Penninsula region? and Ryan Carlyle's answer to Fukushima Dai-ichi Reactors: What is the global worst case scenario that can result from the recent increase in severity level for this incident?     And that is each answer, as of this writing, is wholly unsupported by anything other than ""because Ryan Carlyle says so"" -- but for the last, which is buttressed by stock market charts. (Forgive me for singling you out like this, RC, but you're going to great lengths to assert non-harm, and always on scant or completely absent foundations.)In that respect, they are all quite like this answer to What is the current (early 2012) condition of the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill?, which says, in essence, ""No harm, no foul: -- again, without any documentation. That is quite a different story from the massive catch declines, tumors and other deformities in seafood, and decades of effects that have been reported and predicted by marine scientists studying the Gulf.These effects are being shown by a series of studies -- they're just not shown to you by the U.S. government much, and BP goes to great and largely effective lengths to tell a different story with its PR machine.Trusting governments, trusting power vendors who are on the hook for cleanup costs and liability for health consequences, or trusting undocumented assertions on Quora is foolish.  Embed Quote"

It's something like tripping but without distinct visual hallucinations -- when on acid or shrooms one can typically can see lines and edges and pictures and visualizations, whereas ketamine was a bit more abstract: fuzzy edges of things, taking a few moments to register things in your vision field.Effects vary but sex is interesting, don't accidentally slam a cab door on your knee because you won't notice you've done it until people look at you funny as you walk down the street and you look down and realize you are bleeding profusely, and try to stay within safe areas because your sense of reality goes out the door.

An evidence-based ranking of drugs by potential for harm done by UK scientists placed ketamine just one place behind alcohol, several places more dangerous than cannabis. (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/64740...)As a central nervous system depressant, the main effects and risks of ketamine are not entirely unlike those of alcohol. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic. It impairs perception and physical coordination. It also separates the user's sense of mind and body. Consequently, ketamine users have a much higher than normal risk of accidental physical injury. The drug's anesthetic properties may prevent the user from even realizing they have injured themselves, and the dissociative properties may cause users to fail to appreciate the significance or severity of injury. It is very important to always have a sober person around who can evaluate and respond to the situation in case of emergency.Recreational use of ketamine presents dangers common to most illicit materials. It is very difficult to reliably know much about the purity of material. It is also somewhat difficult to control dose when insufflating an eyeballed amount of ketamine powder (the most typical method of recreational consumption). Because ketamine's effects onset relatively rapidly (typically in less than 10 minutes), some users try to diminish dosing risk by taking a series of small doses.When insufflated, the risk of overdose is very low. However, it is quite easy to inadvertently take an amount that leaves the user in an uncomfortably detached semi-conscious state, often referred to as the K-hole (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-hole).There is increasing evidence for recreational ketamine use leading to bladder and kidney problems (http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/e..., http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/r...).No physiological basis for ketamine addiction has been shown. However, the drug is prone to psychological dependence, which is often casually referred to as ""addictiveness."" Though stopping ketamine use would not result in physical withdrawals as with drugs like cocaine or heroin, many users do feel compelled to take the drug with both increasing frequency and dose.In terms of what it is like, ketamine is highly dose-variant, and is similar to other dissociatives. A light dose is similar to being drunk on alcohol, but more euphoric and with less nausea. It puts the user in a dreamy state, imaginative and comfortably detached from reality. Stronger doses can be much more intense and world-shifting. Perception of time, sound, light, and shapes may vary wildly, sometimes with auditory or visual hallucinations. Some users find this experience extremely enjoyable, others find it terrifying and may become convinced they are trapped forever. A wealth of subjective reports, varying from ecstatic to nightmarish, can be found on Erowid (http://www.erowid.org/experience...).  Embed Quote"

Cyanide is an inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, sarin is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, alcohol overdose shuts down respiration through excessive inhibition of subcortical neurological structures, etc etc. If a person is brought to the hospital but no one knows what they were exposed to, how does a doctor know which antagonists to try?","From IMAI district clinician manual: Hospital care for adolescents and adults, page 163-165Try to determine what was taken (name of drug, product, plant), whether multiple substances were taken (ethanol is often a co-ingestant), how much (strength of tablets, volume, and concentration of liquids), when it was taken (time elapsed since exposure) and the duration of exposure, whether the patient has vomited, and whether any first aid has been given (obtain a description of the fi rstaid). It is also important to find out why the poisoning occurred: was it accidental or deliberate? If the latter (suicide or homicide attempt), then the overdose may be more severe. [...] The route of exposure is important since this may determine the speed of onset of toxic effects. Multiple routes of exposure are possible (e.g. inhalation and dermal).Ask for the container, bottle, or plant sample to be brought in with the patient (it may be found near the patient or in a rubbish bin).Check whether another person was involved.Check the medical and occupational history of the patient since these factors may infl uence the risk of toxicity, e.g. chronic illness such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, drug dependency, occupational exposure to chemicals, or psychological and familial problems. Nutritional status is also important, e.g. malnourishment may increase the risk of toxicity in paracetamol overdose.Check what other medications the patient is taking, including traditional medicines, because these may interact with the substance that has been taken in overdose, resulting in faster onset of toxic effects, or more prolonged or severe toxic effects. The co-ingestion of two serotinergic drugs, for example, increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. An important group of medicines are antiretroviral protease inhibitors, which are metabolised by hepatic P450 enzymes. Ritonavir, for example, inhibits metabolism of dextropropoxyphene resulting in a greater risk of toxicity and a number of protease inhibitors inhibit metabolism of benzodiazepines such as diazepam.Diagnosis and treatment decisions should be based on a combination of the history (identity of the poison, quantity taken), physical examination (assessment of vital signs, presence of characteristic symptoms and signs, i.e. toxidromes), simple bedside laboratory tests (e.g. urine colour tests and SpO2) and general laboratory examinations (blood glucose, ECG, and arterial or venous blood gas). In the case of opioids, a challenge dose of naloxone is diagnostic, but should be given cautiously, especially in opioid-dependent patients.It is important to note that a number of factors affect the risk from poisoning, such as body weight, age, pre-existing health problems, chronic use of medications, and genetic factors. Therefore, the patient should be assessed as a whole, rather than relying on the history of the overdose alone. If a toxicology laboratory is available to measure serum levels, these provide helpful indicators of the need for treatment for certain drugs and toxic substances.If there is no clear history of the agent ingested, the diagnosis of the agent involved should be based on symptoms and signs and a limited number of investigations. If this is not possible, patients should be given supportive care and vital parameters should be stabilized, such as blood pressure and SpO2.Check for emergency signs and to provide emergency treatments as appropriate (e.g. airway management, oxygen, IV fluids, glucose, naloxone).Look in the patient’s mouth and smell the breath.Feel the pulse and do an ECG to check for arrhythmias.Examine the patient from head to toe: look for trauma, cyanosis, blisters, burns in or around the mouth, and check for stridor (laryngeal damage from corrosives).  Embed QuoteAnswered in forty-seven minutes."

I use all three, but only non-BPA Nalgenes.  Here's the Wiki on BPAs:""BPA is controversial because it exerts weak, but detectable, hormone-like properties, raising concerns about its presence in consumer products and foods contained in such products. Starting in 2008, several governments questioned its safety, prompting some retailers to withdraw polycarbonate products. A 2010 report from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised further concerns regarding exposure to fetuses, infants, and young children.[2] In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance.[3][4] The European Union, Canada, and recently the United States have banned BPA use in baby bottles.[5][6]""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bis...  Let's look at 1) Camelback2) Non-BPA Nalgene3) Stainless steel or glass or ceramic1. Camelback has become my absolute favorite for hiking/backpacking/ any physical activity because it's really nice not to have to root around for your water source while you're moving.  It's light, it's safe (non-BPA) and it's easy to fit in a pack.  Downside: you have to clean it carefully, doing a final rinse with alcohol to sterilize and evaporate any leftover water drops that could mildew in the water line.2. Nalgene bottles (non-BPA) are nice because they are light and easy to clean.  We still use one 1-litre bottle for collection/sterilization with a Steri-Pen for cooking and filling the Camelbacks.  Downside:  water tastes funny after it has been in one, especially after a long time or if the bottle has heated from the sun, etc.This is of special concern to me as the parent of a child (see above).  The jury's still out, I may be wrong, but the early research is concerning enough for me to not take undue chances, especially during my son's main growing years.3. Stainless steel/glass/ceramic is my favorite for everyday desk and daypacks/lunchpacks.  It's heavy, but if you don't have to carry it far it's not an issue.  The water simply tastes the best from these non-leaching containers. Steel is the obvious choice for children's lunchboxes/packs because it's non-breakable and dishwasher-safe for sterilization.  Embed Quote"

(They are designed for hydration systems, but I use them just to hold water.) While hiking, I prefer to drink from a 500 cc Nalgene bottle rather than a hydration system because I want to know the amount I am drinking either to make sure I am fully hydrated or to ration water on a long dry stretch - hydration systems usually don't let you know easily how much you are drinking)   So I usually bring 2-3 Nalgene 500 cc wide-mouth bottles for collecting water, for drinking on trail and for convenience. The wide mouths (esp. on the square bottles) make it easy to pick up water from a lake or a shallow stream (small mouths are a pain unless you always use a filter that fits the small mouth).  In winter or over high passes, the wide mouths also allow you to put in some snow periodically to replenish water you are drinking.  I have one round 500cc Nalgene which has the ounce (and cc) measurements printed up the side, which is useful when doing trail cooking (e.g., measuring 8 oz for  my morning oatmeal and 12 oz for evening soups).  I also typically carry one or two square widemouth 500 cc Nalgenes which are wrapped in black 10-mil plumbers tape and are each fitted with a clip that attaches  easily to a PALS strap on my shoulder harness.   (Picture shows the bottle with clear duct tape securing the clip - I now prefer the black tape both for warming and because it is a bit stronger).  The black tape warms up the water, mostly good in winter to melt added snow but also slightly saving fuel if I use it for cooking (if I want water to stay cool, I can put it inside the pack). If you plan to use this in winter, fashion the clip so the bottle hangs with the threads faced downward (the threads will freeze tight if carried upright). If you can carry water forward of your center of gravity it slightly helps you hiking balance. You didn't ask about this, but I will gratuitously add: (1) a folding bucket is a great addition because you can draw plenty of water quickly and then get away from the water's edge (important in our Sierra Nevada mosquito season); and (2) a 17 ounce Platypus bottle is a great way to carry olive oil to add calories to most any dinner or for field-making hummus or tabbouleh (olive oil otherwise likes to leak). Though once used for olive oil, you won't be using it for water.  Grainger.com has a good selection of wide-mouth Nalgene bottles in a variety of sizes and shapes (and with ounce measurements). Platypus bladders are available at REI. PS: a one-ounce Nalgene gives you a way to measure out the olive oil without getting a measuring cup all oily and nasty. Sorry, way too much information is response to a shorter question.   Embed Quote"

Haschek and Rousseaux's Handbook of Toxicologic PathologyIt should also be noted that ""group"" doesn't necessarily imply similar toxicity, it is intended to show the kinds of general physical properties of pure elements. Just because something is a pnictogen doesn't mean we can generalize all its properties as a component in molecules.People are rarely poisoned with ""arsenic""- they are poisoned with arsenic-containing insecticides, which aid transport into the body. Compounds such as Lewisite, a volatile liquid, don't really have an equivalent in Bismuth, but do have equivalents in phosphorous and nitrogen.   Embed Quote"

I have seen IPA on a safety data sheet which said 'May be harmful if inhaled and in contact with skin,' and 'may cause irritation to respiratory tract.' So the answer is yes, it is not the best idea to inhale this vapour, and there are limits to the concentrations in air that you should not exceed known in the UK as Workplace Exposure limits (WELs) for IPA the 8 hour WEL is 980mg/m3 and the short term (15 minute) concentration limit is 1225mg/m3. Thes are the current values and these do change occasionally as more data becomes available on the chemical's effects.If you have to work with this solvent, you should wear gloves, and ensure the area is well ventilated, ideally with a proper Local exhaust Ventilation (LEV) system, to remove fumes from your breathing area. Alternatively you can buy half mask respirators that filter out solvents, but PPE should be a last resort.  Embed Quote"

In biological systems, they often participate in reactions where nucleophiles are added to formyl carbons (oxidative deaminations, forming of imines, forming of hemiacetals) [1]. I'll use aldehydes in cigarette smoke as an example [2]. Over time, these end up accumulating in your lung tissue. One species is formaldehyde which, upon contact with your broncho-epithelial cells, can react with DNA.  Formaldehyde can also irreversibly cross-link with primary amino groups of your proteins or with nitrogen atoms in your DNA by way of a CH2 linkage. This ability to cross-link biological materials together is why it's great for embalming dead bodies.Acrolein is another example. The carboxylic group (C=O) can undergo nucleophilic substitution. The double C-C bond can undergo electrophilic additions, hydroxylations, etc. Now, the smoke contains approximately 33-228 micrograms of acrolein per cigarette [2]. Upon inhalation, it will end up in your respiratory system. In cells, there are many reactions in which it may take part. It might induce covalent modification in proteins. It can also act on certain so-called ""stress genes"" like c-fos (and potentially activate certain transcription factors). In summary, their carcinogencity is a consquence of their reactivity with biological molecules. Compounds with aldehydes tend to be able to participate in a host of reactions which disrupt the delicate and intricate biochemistry taking place in and around our cells.

Common methods to remove these compounds (and thus VOCs) include combustion control (low NOx burners), wet scrubbers, and fabric filter dust collection systems (baghouses). At times dust collection equipment such as baghouses are supplemented with sorbent or activated carbon injection to control elements such as mercury (formerly treated as a VOC by the EPA).

guess this can be measured in terms of toxicity of the venom and probably the actual number of human deaths they inflicted.,"[The original question asked what are the most poisonous snakes in the world]None! Technically snake venom is not a poison, it is a venom. Poisons can be absorbed through the skin or digestive tract whilst venoms have to be injected into the tissue or bloodstream. This is why snake venom can be drunk. This actually happens in parts Asia as it is believed to carry many health benefits.In terms of toxicity there is as yet no definitive answer as the testing systems vary so greatly. There have also been no tests done of all using at least one of these systems. Most importantly though the different venoms may have characteristics that may make them more deadly to the mice they are usually tested on than humans.That being said, it is pretty much accepted that the most toxic venom is that of the sea snakes. In studies done in Costa Rica the pelagic sea snake was found to be more than twice as venomous as any land snake. However, it is rare to receive a fatal bite because almost always only tiny amounts of venom are injected.In terms of percentage of bites resulting in fatalies, the bites of both the black mamba and coastal taipan are almost 100% fatal. Others probably are too. I knew a herpetologist who was at that time the only person who had survived a full black mamba bite. I did a course on snake bites with him many years ago in Zimbabwe. He explained that he had been working with a medical professional on a theory. Black Mambas are neurotoxic and kill by paralysing all the muscles in your body. Your first stop breathing and the last muscle to become paralysed is your heart. Their theory was that if you could keep the person's lungs and heart going artificially until antivenom could work then someone could survive. Amazingly he was bitten by a mamba, rushed to hospital by his wife and the very doctor he worked with met him there (within ten minutes of the bite) and they put him on a heart lung machine and pumped him full of anti-venom and antihystamine. He lived and had no lasting side-effects.Sadly he was bitten again by a black mamba a few years later and this time died before he could get help. Black MambaIn terms of fatalities India has the most fatalities reported of all countries and I believe Spectacled Cobra and Common krait  and [EDIT- Thanks Karandeep Singh] russell's viper are responsible. I have also read about the poor ladies in Sri Lanka who pick tea without protection to their legs and are frequently bitten and die.

The foremost cause of death from cobra , krait or any other neurotoxic snake is respiratory muscle paralysis and since the venom do not effect pathologically to the lungs , O2 saturation of blood can be maintained with ventilators , proper antibiotic cover and acid base management .For Hemotoxins (all vipers) the situation is very different , this category of venom causes hemolysis of the RBCs and prevent the clotting of blood aka disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) . Death is generally due to Multiple organ failure caused by massive internal bleeding and sepsis . Hemotoxic symptoms develop late (upto several days) and if not neutralized by ASVs at appropriate time , the prognosis of the patient's condition is very poor .Even if the ASV is administered early and major amount of venom is successfully neutralized , The damage already done to the Kidneys , spleen and GIT is irreversible . I havent seen any Pit viper or saw scaled viper bitten patient to have survived even though the best possible medical care has been provided at optimum time .  Embed Quote"

They are actually a part of the Pit Viper family, and are capable of striking at up to 2/3rd their body length. The Eastern Diamondback in considered the most venomous species in North America. Surprisingly, juveniles are considered more dangerous than adults, due to their inability to control the amount of venom injected. Most species of rattlesnakes have hemotoxic venom, destroying tissue, degenerating organs and causing coagulopathy (disrupted blood clotting). Some degree of permanent scarring is very likely in the event of a venomous bite, even with prompt, effective treatment, and can lead to the loss of a limb or death. Difficulty breathing, paralysis, drooling and massive hemorrhaging are also common symptoms. Thus, a rattlesnake bite is always a potentially fatal injury. Untreated rattlesnake bites, especially from larger species, are very often fatal. However, antivenin, when applied in time, reduces the death rate to less than 4%#9 - Death Adder:The appropriately named Death Adder is found in Australia and New Guinea. They actually hunt and kill other snakes, including some on this list, usually via ambush. Death Adders look quite similar to vipers, in that they have triangular shaped heads and short, squat bodies. They typically inject around 40-100mg of venom with an LD of 0.4mg-0.5mg/kg. An untreated Death Adder bite is one of the most dangerous in the world. The venom is a neurotoxin. A bite causes paralysis and can cause death within 6 hours, due to respiratory failure. Symptoms generally peak within 24-48 hours. Antivenin is very successful in treating a bite from a Death Adder, particularly due to the relatively slow progression of symptoms, but before its development, a Death Adder bite had a fatality rate of 50%. With the quickest strike in the world, a Death Adder can go from strike position to striking and back again within 0.13 of a second.#8 - Vipers:Vipers are found throughout most of the world, but arguably the most venomous is the Saw Scaled Viper and the Chain Viper, found primarily in the Middle East and Central Asia, particularly India, China and South East Asia. Vipers are quick tempered and generally nocturnal, often active after rains. They are also very fast. Most of these species have venom that cause symptoms that begin with pain at the site of the bite, immediately followed by swelling of the affected extremity. Bleeding is a common symptom, especially from the gums. There is a drop in blood pressure and the heart rate falls. Blistering occurs at the site of the bite, developing along the affected limb in severe cases. Necrosis is usually superficial and limited to the muscles near the bite, but may be severe in extreme cases. Vomiting and facial swelling occurs in about one-third of all cases. Severe pain may last for 2-4 weeks. Often, local swelling peaks within 48-72 hours, involving the affected limb. Discoloration may occur throughout the swollen area as red blood cells and plasma leak into muscle tissue. Death from septicaemia, respiratory or cardiac failure may occur 1 to 14 days post-bite, or even later.#7 - Philippine Cobra:Most species of Cobra would not make this list; however the Philippine Cobra is the exception. Drop for drop, its venom is the most deadly of all the Cobra species, and they are capable of spitting it up to 3 metres. The venom is a neurotoxin which affects cardiac and respiratory function, and can cause neurotoxicity, respiratory paralysis and death in thirty minutes. The bite causes only minimal tissue damage. The neurotoxins interrupt the transmission of nerve signals by binding to the neuro-muscular junctions near the muscles. The symptoms might include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, collapse and convulsions.#6 - Tiger Snake:Found in Australia, the Tiger snake has a very potent neurotoxic venom. Death from a bite can occur within 30 minutes, but usually takes 6-24 hours. Prior to the development of antivenin, the fatality rate from Tiger snakes was 60-70%. Symptoms can include localized pain in the foot and neck region, tingling, numbness and sweating, followed by a fairly rapid onset of breathing difficulties and paralysis. The Tiger snake will generally flee if encountered, but can become aggressive when cornered. It strikes with unerring accuracy.#5 - Black Mamba:The feared Black Mamba is found throughout many parts of the African continent. They are known to be highly aggressive, and strike with deadly precision. They are also the fastest land snake in the world, capable of reaching speeds of up to 20km/h. These fearsome snakes can strike up to 12 times in a row. A single bite is capable of killing anywhere from 10-25 adults. The venom is a fast acting neurotoxin. Its bite delivers about 100–120 mg of venom, on average; however, it can deliver up to 400 mg. If the venom reaches a vein, 0.25 mg/kg is sufficient to kill a human in 50% of cases. The initial symptom of the bite is local pain in the bite area, although not as severe as snakes with hemotoxins. The victim then experiences a tingling sensation in the mouth and extremities, double vision, tunnel vision, severe confusion, fever, excessive salivation (including foaming of the mouth and nose) and pronounced ataxia (lack of muscle control). If the victim does not receive medical attention, symptoms rapidly progress to severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, pallor, shock, nephrotoxicity, cardio toxicity and paralysis. Eventually, the victim experiences convulsions, respiratory arrest, coma and then death. Without antivenin, the mortality rate is nearly 100%, among the highest of all venomous snakes. Depending on the nature of the bite, death can result at any time between 15 minutes and 3 hours.#4 - Taipan:Another entry from Australia, the venom in a Taipan is strong enough to kill up to 12,000 guinea pigs. The venom clots the victim’s blood, blocking arteries or veins. It is also highly neurotoxic. Before the advent of an antivenin, there are no known survivors of a Taipan bite, and death typically occurs within an hour. Even with successful administration of antivenin, most victims will have an extensive stay in intensive care. It has been likened to the African Black Mamba in morphology, ecology and behavior.#3 - Blue Krait:The Malayan or Blue Krait is, by far, the most deadly of this species. Found throughout South East Asia and Indonesia, 50% of bites from the deadly Blue Krait are fatal, even with the administration of antivenin. Kraits hunt and kill other snakes, even cannibalizing other Kraits. They are a nocturnal breed, and are more aggressive under the cover of darkness. However, overall they are quite timid and will often attempt to hide rather than fight. The venom is a neurotoxin, 16 times more potent than that of a Cobra. It quickly induces muscle paralysis by preventing the ability of nerve endings to properly release the chemical that sends the message to the next nerve. This is followed by a period of massive over excitation (cramps, tremors, spasms), which finally tails off to paralysis. Fortunately, bites from Kraits are rare due to their nocturnal nature. Before the development of antivenin, the fatality rate was a whopping 85%. Even if antivenin is administered in time, you are far from assured survival. Death usually occurs within 6-12 hours of a Krait bite. Even if patients make it to a hospital, permanent coma and even brain death from hypoxia may occur, given potentially long transport times to get medical care.#2 - Eastern Brown Snake:Don’t let the innocuous name of this snake fool you, 1/14,000 of an ounce of its venom is enough to kill an adult human. Coming in a variety of species, the Eastern Brown snake is the most venomous. Unfortunately, its preferred habitat is also along the major population centers of Australia. The Brown snake is fast moving, can be aggressive under certain circumstances and has been known to chase aggressors and repeatedly strike at them. Even juveniles can kill a human. The venom contains both neurotoxins and blood coagulants. Fortunately for humans, less than half of bites contain venom and they prefer not to bite if at all possible. They react only to movement, so stand very still if you ever encounter one in the wild.#1 - Fierce Snake or Inland Taipan:The incredible Inland Taipan has the most toxic venom of any land snake in the world. The maximum yield recorded for one bite is 110mg, enough to kill about 100 humans, or 250,000 mice! With an LD/50 of 0.03mg/kg, it is 10 times as venomous as the Mojave Rattlesnake, and 50 times more than the common Cobra. Fortunately, the Inland Taipan is not particularly aggressive and is rarely encountered by humans in the wild. No fatalities have ever been recorded, though it could potentially kill an adult human within 45 minutes.Other snakes worthy of being on the list:#1 - Belcher’s Sea Snake:The most venomous snake known in the world, a few milligrams is strong enough to kill 1000 people! Less than 1/4 of bites will contain venom, and they are relatively docile. Fisherman are usually the victims of these bites, as they encounter the species when they pull nets from the ocean. Found throughout waters off South East Asia and Northern Australia.D.  Embed Quote"

I remember watching a program which listed the deadliest snakes on the planet. So here’s applying that knowledge to answer your question. There are several parameters to measure how venomous a snake bite is, but for this question let’s consider the most simple and useful one – Potential Deaths per bite.1.  Inland Taipan-The most venomous snake in the world. This is baddest snake in all of the Australian outback. Sure there are other marine snakes whose poison is even stronger when compared drop by drop, however, their venom volume is far from enough to consider them life threatening.Avg. Venom per bite: 77mgNo of human deaths per bite- 44 .2. The Common Krait- We actually found one of these in our house 5 years ago in New Delhi. Found abundantly in the forests and farmlands of India. They prey on other snakes and can even turn cannibalistic. They are not aggressive toward humans even when provoked, they prefer to coil and hide their heads for protection. The bites are usually a result of close encounters in inhabited areas; sometimes these snakes chose to make human habitation their own.Avg. Venom per bite: 30mgNo of human deaths per bite-113. Tiger Snake- Again an inhabitant of Australia .These snake can differ broadly in their appearance but they usually have stripes resembling those of a Tiger (hence the name) and they can reach a length of up to 6 feet (2m). The Tiger Snake possesses a powerful cocktail of drugs. The venom is among the most powerful; it is simultaneously Hemotoxic, Neurotoxic and Myotoxic.Avg. Venom per bite: 112mgNo of human deaths per bite-8The next spot is a tie between the Black Mamba , The death adder and the Australian Brown Snake. They will all kill about 4 humans with a single bite.Though the black mamba features pretty late on this list compared to its reputation, it should be noted that it probably is the most dangerous snakeas it is super aggressive and can run like the wind with a top speed of 12 km per hour.Shows you death inside its mouth.

In the USA, I just learned, it's called ""Bushmaster"". Coral snakes, pn the other hand, despite having a much more powerful venom, aren't nearly as dangerous, because they are tiny and shy. Jeans are most times a sufficient barrier to protect your legs.   Embed Quote"

[1]Let's say the ""average"" person is a 180-lb male; every drink they have within an hour adds roughly .02 BAC; this means they would need to have more than 15 drinks in this hour to reach a BAC of .30 - still not quite enough to kill them.If we say the ""average"" person is a 140-lb female; every drink they have within an hour adds roughly .03 BAC; this means they would need to have around 10 drinks in this same hour to reach a BAC of .30 - again, not quite enough to kill them.BAC spikes, then diminishes over time, on a fairly predictable curve.  Which allows us to use some fun calculators.  According to this[2] one, a 180-lb man would have a BAC of .384 (definitely in the danger zone) after having 20 shots over 4 hours.  Our 140-lb woman hits .386 after 14 shots over the same 4 hours.Using that same BAC calculator, if you narrow the time limit to 30 minutes, then the man hits .353 at 16 shots and the woman hits .349 at only 11 shots.[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blo...[2] http://bloodalcoholcalculator.or...  Embed Quote"

Some of them accumulate and some of them do long-lasting damage to cell membranes and DNA. Meanwhile, CO is nontoxic to plants and doesn't do damage to cell membranes/DNA. It's acutely toxic (just because it takes up hemoglobin slots that oxygen would otherwise take up), but people have already adopted safety measures for the acutely toxic things. They just systematically underestimate the risk from the things that aren't acutely toxic, but that can do long-lasting damage.Yes, I know that sublethal doses of CO can be bad. But these are related to oxygen deprivation and not the effects of CO itself. To the extent that CO doesn't significantly depress the body's usage of oxygen, I don't worry about it as much as I worry about the VOCs and particulate matter.But, I'd really like to see anyone else who might say something else.","In the UK, in Post-Mortems (autopsy) we do not routinely screen for Carbon Monoxide in the blood (COHb) , we do not know how big a problem it is. A good document is the Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide - to me it seems we are tolerant to low levels (concentrations)  of Carbon Monoxide over short periods, the real issue comes with low levels over a greater period. The drive for better insulation in the home, fuel efficiency and airtightness in building I personally believe means this issue will grow in importance. At he moment I campaign hard to just get Working Smoke Alarms and Working Carbon Monoxide Alarms into homes, but I think they will come a time, where we will have Wifi or Zigbee enabled Alarms and our iPad's (Tablets) will graph the CO in our homes over time.  Embed Quote"

Factories in places like China, and/or their suppliers, might intentionally or accidentally make changes to a product after it has been tested.

Like most proteins, it degrades over time, and complex chemicals like venoms probably degrade fast. Plus, if the venom is mixing in with the enzymes in the rest of the squished spider, it will get digested. So don't worry about it.Let's say the venom does last, though. The amount of venom in a spider is tiny: they aren't made of poison, they just have a puny pair of glands in their small head. For most spiders, the venom has little to no effect on humans when injected into the skin, so it touching an open wound might not do much. Some spiders do have powerful venoms, and it's plausible that they could enter an open wound. The odds that you are encountering such a spider with a bad poison, however, and the odds that you squish it in such a way that the venom does not get digested by the squished stomach or denatured by whatever other compounds are in the spider goo, and the odds that it will enter an open wound on a foot, are all so tiny that you needn't be concerned about this.Or, you know, don't kill the spider. Be nice and shoo it outside!  Embed QuoteVia  Daniel McLaury."

You need to figure out whether you really need a detox, and what type of detox is required for you. You need to ""study your body"" under a trained Ayurvedic physician to be able to understand the effects of all the 3 ayurvedic ""doshas"" (forces) on your body.Just because some minds are not capable of comprehending Ayurveda & Panchakarma does not mean it is ineffective. And Ayurveda is a holistic science - there are ""no size fits all"" solutions to all problems.

Echoing Anonymous' answer below, there's no doubt that detoxification is a long held practice although in varying forms. But, it's all the sh** we eat that gets stuck in our body and causes leading diseases. Our colon can be likened to our body's sewage system and a detox lessens the toxic load it has to carry. Having tried it, I can tell you that it makes me feel more energized.So what is legitimate and what is quackery? In my oversimplified opinion, something is legitimate in healthcare and medicine if it indeed makes you feel better or the side effects are less than the cost of what the medicine is preventing. This brings Adderall and the whole debate of the ADHD ""epidemic"" into question, but that's out of scope. Because I have tried it and because it did make me feel better after having it done, I'd call colon hydroptherapy legitimate. Whether all forms of detoxification are, I'm not sure. I'd be interested in knowing what makes a person's answer to this question ""legitimate"" if he/she has not had a colon cleanse or done a serious detox.If you want to read more of what Marianne has to say, here's a link to the post: TMI Colonics Keeps Your Digestion (& Humor) On Track  Embed Quote"

It is primarily consumed in Japan as puffer soup (fugu chiri) or raw puffer meat (sashimi fugu). If not prepared properly, it can kill you....sashimi fugu often causes intoxication, light-headedness, and numbness of the lips, and is often eaten for this reason.Pufferfish tetrodotoxin deadens the tongue and lips, and induces dizziness and vomiting, followed by numbness and prickling over the body, rapid heart rate, decreased blood pressure, and muscle paralysis. The toxin paralyzes diaphragm muscles and stops the person who has ingested it from breathing. People who live longer than 24 hours typically survive, although possibly after a coma lasting several days.From Wikipedia [1]I once saw in a documentary that people actually consider it a feat of courage to eat dishes containing puffer fish. The chefs who make it have to undergo rigorous training, and only 35% of those who apply to be professional fugu chefs pass. Trying to prepare a fugu dish at home most often leads to death.A plate of sashimi fugu.

Nothing could                  be further from the truth.                       The freedom of people to choose natural healing,  alternative medicine                 and methods of disease prevention  could soon be threatened by corporate                 lobbyists who will  do anything to protect their wealth at the expense                 of  your health.                    Promoters of                 conventional  medicine claim that all the drug studies, approvals,                  surgical procedures,  all other treatments are based                 on  scientific evidence.  But is it really science? What passes for  ""science""                 today is a collection of health myths,  half-truths, intellectual                 dishonesty and  fraudulent  reporting to help serve higher interests. Science is not really science anymore.                    90 percent of                 all diseases  (cancer, diabetes, depression, heart disease, etc.)                 are  easily preventable through diet, nutrition, sunlight and exercise.                  None of these solutions are ever promoted by conventional  medicine                 because they make no money.                    No pharmaceuticals                 actually cure  or resolve the underlying causes of disease. Even                  ""successful"" drugs only manage symptoms, usually at the                  cost of interfering with other physiological functions that will                  cause side effects down the road. There is no such thing as a  drug                 without a side effect.                    There is no                 financial incentive  for anyone in today's system of medicine (drug                  companies, hospitals, doctors, etc.) to actually make patients well.                  Profits are found in continued sickness, not wellness or  prevention.                    Almost all                 the ""prevention""  programs you see today (such as free                 mammograms or other  screening programs) are nothing more than  patient recruitment schemes  designed to increase revenue and sickness. They use free screenings                  to scare people into agreeing to unnecessary treatments that  only lead to further disease. Mammography is a very good example. Chemotherapy is another. Nobody has any                 interest in your health except you. No  corporation, no doctor, and                 no government has any desire  to actually make you well. This has                 served the  short-term financial interests of higher powers in the                  west very well. The only healthy, aware, critically thinking individuals                  are all 100% free of pharmaceuticals and processed  foods.YTH #2 Vaccines prevent diseases and increase immunity.                                                                  The term                     ""immunization"",  often substituted for vaccination,                     is false and  should be legally challenged. Medical research                     has  well established that the direct injection of foreign proteins                      and other toxic material (particularly known  immune-sensitising                     poisons such as mercury) makes  the recipient more, not less,                     easily affected by  what he/she encounters in the future. This                     means  they do the opposite of immunize, commonly even preventing                      immunity from developing after natural exposure.                         The actual                     frequency of  health problems has been estimated by authorities                     to  be possibly up to 100 times, or more, greater than that reported                      by government agencies. That difference is due to the lack  of                     enforcement or incentive for doctors to report  adverse effects.                     With the anti-vaccination movements  now exposing the truth on                     the internet, the medical  community is now on high alert, defending                     their  claims and being told by vaccine manufacturers that they                      must never let their patients (or parents) think that the risks                      could outweigh the benefits, when in reality, it is  precisely                     the opposite that is true.                          The benefit risk ratio is an important  decision in anyone deciding                   whether to vaccinate or  not. Contrary to popular belief and marketing,                    childhood diseases in a developed country are not as dangerous                    as we are led to believe. Catching a particular disease does  not                   mean you willdie from it. Vaccines were actually introduced at a time when                    diseases had already declined to a low risk level. This fact is                    proven, scientifically.                          The main advances in combating   disease over  the last 200 years have been better   food and clean drinking  water...not vaccines. Improved sanitation, less overcrowded   and better  living conditions also   contribute. This is also borne out   in  published peer reviewed research which prove that vaccine did not save us.All vaccines contain sterility agents, neurotoxins, immunotoxins, and carcinogenic compounds. Some examples include formaldehyde, a carcinogen found in almost every vaccine,  neurotoxins such as monosodium glutamate, potassium                 chloride, thimerosal, sterility agents such as Triton X-100, octoxynol-10, polysorbate 80, and immuntoxins such as neomycin, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium deoxycholate to name a few of many. It is no coincidence that the more educated you are, the less chance you will vaccinate which contradicts the misconceptions of many health  professionals who      profess that parents don't vaccinate because they are  under-educated,     poor or misinformed. Those who become fully informed  of the dangers of   vaccines never see them in the same light again, as  their motives then   become clear.                           MYTH #3 We must all focus on lowering bad cholesterol.                          Perhaps one                 of the biggest  health myths propagated in western culture and certainly                  in the United States, is the misuse of an invented term ""bad                 cholesterol""  by the media and medical community. Moreover,                 a  scientifically-naive public has been conned into a fraudulent                  correlation between elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular  disease                 (CVD). Cholesterol has not been shown to  actually cause CVD. To                 the contrary, cholesterol is  vital to our survival, and trying to                 artificially lower  it can have detrimental effects, particularly                 as we age.We have become a culture so obsessed with eating foods                        low in cholesterol and fat that many health experts are now    questioning the consequences. Could we really maintain a dietary     lifestyle that was so  foreign to many of our ancestral populations    without any ill effects on our health? Many researchers are now    concluding that the answer to that question is ""NO."" Current data is now    suggesting that lower cholesterol levels predate the development of    cancer.The 'noddy-science' offered by marketing men to a generally                        scientifically-naive public has led many people to    believe that                     we should replace certain food choices    with specially developed                     products that can help    'reduce cholesterol'. Naturally this                     comes at a    price and requires those who can afford it to pay                        maybe four or five times what a 'typical ordinary' product might                        cost. But is this apparent 'blanket need' to strive  towards                       lowering our cholesterol justified? And,  indeed, is   it healthy?The cholesterol itself, whether being transported                     by    LDL or HDL,                     is exactly the same. Cholesterol is    simply a necessary ingredient                     that is required to  be   regularly delivered around the body for                     the    efficient healthy development, maintenance and functioning                        of our cells. The difference is in the 'transporters' (the    lipoproteins                     HDL and LDL) and both types are    essential for the human body's                     delivery logistics to    work effectively. Problems can occur, however, when the LDL particles are both                        small and their carrying capacity outweighs the  transportation                       potential of available HDL. This  can lead to more   cholesterol                     being 'delivered'  around the body with   lower resources for returning                      excess capacity to the   liver. MYTH #4 Medical screening and treatments prevent death.                          Even though the medical community advocates  for regular screenings                     for those with illnesses,  they may bring little benefit and                     may actually pose  harm to your health. This applies to almost                     every  type of medical screening for cancer and several other                      diseases. Medical screening carries an immense risk in itself,                      not only due to the damage inflicted by screening  techniques                     on the human body, but by the very nature  of medical follow-up                     protocols. These protocols  usually encourage patients to enter                     deeper into more  invasive techniques, which further cripple                     health  and lead to a very high percentage of fatalities.                          In a Swedish study of 60,000   women, 70  percent of    the mammographically detected tumors weren't   tumors at  all. These ""false    positives"" aren't just financial and   emotional  strains, they may also    lead to many unnecessary and   invasive  biopsies. In fact, 70 to 80 percent    of all positive   mammograms do not, upon biopsy, show any presence of cancer.                          A prostate (PSA) blood test looks for  prostate-specific                    antigen, a protein produced by the  prostate gland. High levels                    are supposedly associated  with prostate cancer. The problem                    is that the  association isn't always correct, and when it is,                    the  prostate cancer isn't necessarily deadly. Only about 3 percent of all  men die from prostate cancer. The                    PSA test usually  leads to overdiagnosis -- biopsies and treatment                    in  which the side effects are impotence and incontinence. Repeated biopsies   may spread cancer cells                    into the track formed by  the needle, or by spilling cancerous                    cells directly  into the bloodstream or lympathic system.News coverage                     of many  diseases focus too much on treatments and not enough                      on prevention, a trend that could prove risky in the long run                      for most people who don't understand how to take care of  their                     health.                           The biggest single type of story we usually  hear about on the                     news involves treatment, and  narratives lend themselves much                     better to that kind  of story. Stories about prevention, about                     people  exercising and eating right, just don’t make great                     copy.                         If our current                     treatment  approach to health continues, hundreds of years from                      now, mankind may look back at today’s “modern medicine”                      and think: “How could they have been so primitive in ideology                      and so wrong? What lack of humanitarianism in government  allowed                     the medical industries to kill people with  economically driven                     false beliefs and ideas? Why  didn’t government stop them?                     Who were the people in  charge of protecting those citizens?                                                    Preventive                     education  demands increased funding for research into new dietary,                      physical activity, behavioural, socioeconomic, environmental                      and medical approaches for the prevention of chronic  disease.                     Children who grow into teenagers and then  adults require more                     accountability for their own  well-being through health conscious                     decisions which  are motivated by proper practical and theoretical                      applications. They need to know that treatment modalities and                      pharmaceutical applications may not save their health in the                      future. Substantial political and financial  contributions are                     also imperative to invest in  prevention more effectively to                     regulate revisions  and mandate policies which affect the governing                      bodies of health and education. Any procrastination or failure                      to resolve these matters in the next decade will only lead to                      the further deterioration of human health and  healthcare systems.                     Proper leadership and effective  communication regarding these                     preventive measures  may still reverse screening/treatment trends                     and  consequently reverse this thinking to ultimately promote                      a healthier aging population.MYTH #5 Fluoride prevents tooth decay.Water fluoridation is a hoax.  Drinking any                 amount of fluoride is dangerous to your  health and has NEVER been                 proven to prevent tooth decay.  It's actually the biggest scientific                 fraud ever to be  promoted by national and international Governments.                  Fluoride has been linked to osteoporosis, cancer, auto-immune diseases,                  and even very small concentrations can disrupt DNA  repair enzymes                 by 50%.  The fluoride added to our water is a waste product of   aluminum and    phosphate fertilizer processing. And it’s not even calcium   fluoride    that appears naturally in water, but sodium fluoride, which is a    whole   different thing--and loaded with bad news.  In fact, sodium fluoride has no good news. Except for a few suspect      reports by the people selling the stuff, study after research study      proves that sodium fluoride does not protect our teeth, and it does a      number on our bones. And on other body parts, too, including our  thyroid     gland.  - Fluoride was found to be an equivocal carcinogen by the                                                    National Cancer Institute  Toxicological Program.   - Drinking fluoridated water will double the number of hip                         fractures for both older men and women.     -  Infertility in women was found to increase with water                          fluoridation.                       Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) scientists reported                         a close  correlation between decreasing total fertility rates                          in women between ages of 10 and 49, and increasing fluoride                          levels.                           - Fluoride has never been found to   effectively reducing tooth decay by any notable margin.                         No causation or even correlation was found between the level of  fluoride                         in water and dental caries in any  study.  Fluoride also attacks the pineal  gland. The pineal controls our  inner     clock, provides good sleep, works with our adrenal glands to  handle     stress, keeps the thymus gland fed and cared for, and  communicates 24/7     with the rest of the endocrine system about how  things are going.     Fluoride calcifies our pineal gland into a  non-functioning rock.                          -                          The government classifies sodium fluoride as  environmentally     hazardous waste. Anybody handling it must wear  HazMat protective gear.     Dumping it into rivers is a crime.                          Much of                     the original  proof that fluoride is safe for   humans in low doses                      was generated by A-bomb program   scientists, who had been secretly                      ordered to   provide ""evidence useful in litigation""                      against   defense contractors for fluoride injury to  citizens.                       The first lawsuits against the U.S.  A-bomb program were not                       over radiation, but over  fluoride damage, the documents show.                          It seems that the healthiest  people on the planet right now are those that have deviated from the  norms of conventional medical quackery, and have migrated towards  natural health. The proof is in the pudding. Find the healthiest 5  people you know and you'll find they typically don't subscribe to the  health myths promoted by mainstream medicine. Your longevity and aging  gracefully depends on it.                                          Marco Torres is a research specialist, writer and     consumer advocate                                  for healthy lifestyles. He holds     degrees in  Public         Health     and                     Environmental Science  and       is a         professional     speaker on topics                    such   as   disease           prevention,     environmental toxins  and health     policy.Okay I am skeptik about the first two, but the last one is really bothering me the most...The water full of carcinogen..? Could it be true?","Virtually all information presented by these people is false or deliberately misleading. They are charlatans. They employ scare tactics to drive up their page views, then sell advertising space to the true snake oil salesmen. Sorry, but if it's from a site that posts these conspiracy theories it's wrong or it's information perverted to sound convincing. They are scum.1. This is where alarm bells ring. ""Mainstream medicine"" he says, like there are valid alternatives. Then of course he sets the scene, this one is not about being truthful, it's about setting up the pitch. He needs to convince you the legion of people who are going to school, working 18 hour days and breaking their backs to give care to the ill are EVIL, because if they weren't pure satan excrement how could you believe they are part of a vast conspiracy to make (and keep) people sick. He also attacks science, because when he makes later arguments, science will not help his cause. Like I said, this is just groundwork though and is meant to reach out to those who follow alternative medicine. You can tell from his mentioning of them as realistic option, and his mention of ""the vast corporate hegemony"" attacking it.He mentions how exercise, diet and sunlight are the three things you need to be healthy. But he implies that doctors don't tell people these things, like it's some kind of huge secret the way most of us live is unhealthy.Of course he finishes with ""the only healthy people are the ones who don't take medicine"" which makes me think he's not all that good at this. Or thinking in general.2. Vaccines! I just have no words for this one. Is taking yearly flu vaccinations over the top? Shit, probably, just get the flu and run the chance of death you pussy. Vaccines for kids? In my day kids dropped like flies and you know what? We liked it that way! Helped the cream rise to the top!Seriously though this is mostly propaganda. He makes an appeal to intelligence (smart people don't vaccinate). He fully embraces the science he rejected earlier because it proves his point and he uses the anti-vaccination network as proof there is something wrong with vaccinations. That's like saying since the KluKluxKlan exists, black people are subhuman.3. Fuck you Mr Writer AND fuck the doctors. I'll eat what I like and get a bypass. (At least I am honest.)4. Medical testing doesn't save lives???   Maybe he's right, I assume cancer just goes away if you don't check for it.Like pulses in babies. I did get a little hot under the collar when he talked about the results of prostate cancer and tried to say the ""negative side effects"" were worth leaving the cancer untreated. ""Don't check for cancer, it might spread the cancer through your system"" he said that. He fucking said it. Not me. Him.5. Helps teeth, only causes the symptoms he mentioned at ludicrously higher doses than we receive. Based off tests on children in India exposed to huge chemical contamination. Since he's using the suffering of children to sell bottled water, is he evil?Yes. Yes he is.  Embed Quote"

In most cases it is assumed that the women mistook the effects of alcohol for date rape drugs.[3][4]*So yes, alcohol has a distinctive taste, and it is a drug, as Karen has written.Rohypnol has no taste or smell.Other drugs used in DFSA include hypnotics such as zopiclone or the widely available zolpidem (Ambien), sedatives such as neuroleptics (anti-psychotics) Quetiapine ""Seroquel"" or Ziprasidone ""Geodon"", chloral hydrate or some histamine H1 antagonists, recreational drugs such as ethanol, marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and LSD, and anticholinergics,barbiturates, ketamine, cough suppressant ingredient dextromethorphan, opioids and nasal spray ingredient oxymetazoline.[6][11] Some may taste bitter, and of course, not all are orally administered. *Researchers note that the media scare in the 90's has left a permanent misconception about date rape drug usage: In a 2008 study by the University of Kent, researchers found that young female students often “mistakenly linked sickness, blackouts and dizziness to poisoning by a stranger — when it was likely to be caused by excessive alcohol consumption.”[44] Commenting on the research, Nick Ross, chair of the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, confirms that many women’s fear of being drugged — or belief that they have been — is unfounded. “There is no evidence of widespread use of hypnotics in sexual assault, let alone Rohypnol, despite many attempts to prove the contrary.” Though excessive fear and protective measures had significantly subsided by the late 2000s relative its peak in the late 1990s, a 2009 Australian study found that of 97 instances of patients admitted to the hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked, tests were able to detect drugs in none.[40]Some scholars claim that this extensive coverage has created or amplified a moral panic[45] rooted in societal anxieties about rape, hedonism and the increased freedoms of women in modern culture. Researchers say it has given a powerful added incentive for the suppression of party drugs,[42] has inappropriately undermined the long-established argument that recreational drug use is purely a consensual and victimless crime, has threatened to seriously curtail women's sexual and social freedoms, and by shining a spotlight on premeditated clearly predatory behaviour, has relieved the culture from having to explore and evaluate more nuanced forms of male sexual aggression towards women, such as those displayed in date rapes that were not facilitated by the surreptitious administration of drugs.[46]Source: Date rape drug  Embed QuoteVia  W.

Within subclasses of medicines, drugs may share the same toxicological profiles (i.e. Statins have the same bio-clearance, analgesics have similar half-life profiles). But the reasons why one group 'fails' in a clinical trial will be different to another. There are many different stages to a clinical trial. They are normally referred to as 'phases'. Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into fouror five phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as aseparate clinical trial. The objectives of a phase 0 clinical trial are toestablish at the very earliest opportunity-before large numbers of patientshave been accrued and exposed to potential drug-associated toxicity-whetherfurther clinical development is warranted. Phase I trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects and these typically involve a small group (20-60) of healthy volunteers. The safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacodynamics and other attributes of a drug are determined before the number of volunteers and strength/dose of the drug is scaled up through the other phases. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups of people and even larger more varied groups (anywhere from 250-2,000) are used for phase III trials. Most drugs fail in phase II. Many drug failures are caused by unforeseen side effects. Introducing the drug to a more varied population also bring sup situations, circumstances and problems researchers may otherwise not have been able to test for. Much like with beta testing of software.A drug can also fail because the disease does not work the way the investigator thinks. Again, results from a narrow group of volunteers in the earlier trials will vary much more when the drug is exposed to other people (i.e. not mice or computer models).  Embed Quote"

7 p.m. on a cold Chicago evening (January 2004), I arrived home a bit surprised that dinner was not already underway. My wife was in the bedroom with our 2 year old toddler. She said he had gotten sleepy under the dining room table and now seemed pretty listless. She thinks maybe he has a cold. She also mentioned that our 8 year old had gone to lie down, complaining of a headache. But she herself didn't seem inclined to get up. So I went to check on him...Our older child was lying on his bed. He seemed a bit weird to me. Not quite sleeping, but I couldn't rouse him either. He'd open his eyes -- but not wake up, though he did moan or make sounds.The situation with our children struck me as odd. However, when I went back  to my wife, she seemed even less inclined to talk it through. She also felt headachy, nauseous, and just wanted to rest. (She tells me that she remembers thinking, oh, this is what a panic attack feels like. She never had one, but she figured she should lie down and be calm!! )Part of me wanted to eat dinner alone, but it just seemed so strange  for them to be so sleepy. It was like they were drugged and I didn't get it. Just thinking about it seemed to make me feel spacey myself. It felt difficult to think clearly; somehow the apartment seemed stuffy to me. It occurred to me that maybe I would catch the same bug and I felt  faint. Feeling spooked, I opened up the window, stuck my head out and gulped the freezing air. It occurred to me to call a friend for advice. I tried calling one friend. Then I called our downstairs neighbor. (We're on the top, 3rd floor of a 6 flat building.) She told me that her daughter had felt really faint, so they had opened their windows. She said the gas people came by earlier and found a problem...Suddenly, I kicked into high gear. It was like being pumped simultaneously with an anesthetic and adrenaline. First, I snatched the baby, ran downstairs to the foyer, left him on the cold floor, banged on the apartment doors and  screamed for help, and immediately ran back upstairs for the 8 year old. I managed to hoist him into a fireman's carry and brought him down. Started to run back upstairs. But I felt weak and realized that I might be unable to carry down my wife and would just pass out. So I ran barefoot out the building and into the snowy-slushy street. I stopped the one car. Felt focused and desperate. Fortunately, there was a big guy nearby who got the point. He went with me upstairs and carried my wife downstairs.My head cleared fairly quickly in the cold. My wife and older son were able to walk, assisted, by the time the ambulance arrived. They all did fine after some oxygen and rest.P.S. Unlike a gas leak, the CO emissions from the broken furnace exhaust had no smell. It can cause irreversible brain damage and death. We got a CO detector for our apartment the next day...Update.

Of course, I didn't know that at the time. All I knew was that the apartment was kind of warm. I was pretty exhausted from a transcontinental flight, and had been planning on taking a nap after checking email, but didn't after it became apparent something was wrong. I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy and started getting a terrible ""head going to explode"" headache. Like I said, I was really tired, but when I started to realize that I felt like I was going to pass out, I called up a friend, told him that I was alone in my apartment and felt like I was going to pass out, and asked him to routinely check up on me to make sure I was conscious. He asked me what he should do if I don't pick up, and I told him to call 911. I think he was put off by how chill I was, but agreed. Since I couldn't concentrate on work and wanted to stay awake, I decided to stay on my feet and do housework. When I was cleaning my kitchen I figured out that the oven was on. I turned off the oven, opened all the windows, and turned on some fans. Then I called my friend, who told me to go to the hospital, so I called the hospital, who told me to call 911, so I called 911 and the firefighters and paramedics came to my apartment.Everything was fine in the end, but it really ruined my day.  Embed Quote"

I had cabin fever (too much time indoors) and just had to get out for awhile so I drove 45 minutes to the movie theater in town.The road salt had eaten away at the bottom of my vehicle and I could see the road through the holes.  I had the heat set on high and, of course, the windows were closed.  I think that the salt finally corroded enough of the exhaust system so that there were holes in the pipe and exhaust fumes got into the vehicle's cabin.As I was driving along, I started to become disoriented, nauseous, dizzy and developed a headache.  Because the symptoms were so gradual, I didn't make an immediate connection to the leaky exhaust.  Fortunately, the roads were fairly empty so I didn't have an accident.  When I finally arrived at the theater, I got out of the car and experienced one of the most piercing headaches of my life. I wobbled to the theater door.  My face was numb (but not from the cold) and I could barely talk.The fresh air did revive me somewhat then it dawned on me; I had CO poisoning.  I remembered from one of my chemistry courses that CO has an affinity for red blood cells that is several hundred times greater than oxygen.  I was breathing, but I wasn't absorbing enough oxygen.I sat through the movie and eventually recovered.  On the long way back, I opened all the windows and froze; this time I was numb with the cold.  The temperature was well below zero F.I had the vehicle repaired the next day.  I also installed a CO detector in my house which can emit an incredibly loud ear piercing noise.  Embed Quote"

When we got to the house we found it was warm and realized the heat had been left on from the previous tenants over a week ago. Even though we planned to work on the house that night, we decided instead to sit and watch a movie. About 30min into the movie, my father decided to go to bed. I fell asleep on the couch soon after, too tired to go to my bed. I woke up because my heart was racing and I had sweat through my clothes. I was convinced that I must have the flu. I called to my father and he called back that he was getting out of bed but he never came. I tried to get up but my body was too heavy. I went back to sleep, but woke up again in the same state, so again I called to my father, but this time he didn't answer. I forced myself up and went to his room to find him unconscious. I found his cell phone and called 911, telling them that both my father and I were very ill and I mentioned I also thought I was having a panic attack because my heart was beating extremely fast. The dispatcher told me to take deep breaths and I subsequently went unconscious, as well. I woke up to firemen in the room opening the windows and shouting about carbon monoxide. Waking up, I remember that I was soaking wet in sweat, my heart was beating rapidly, and I felt terrified, which I think is partially attributed to the confusion I was feeling. I also could not feel my body, and moving was very difficult. My father was still unconscious and on a stretcher, and I was picked up and carried out. In the ambulance my father woke up and was actually angry, insisting he was only asleep and he wanted to go back to bed. I remember that his face was unusually red, which I later found out was a symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning. The paramedics explained to him that he was poisoned and that if I didn't call 911 we would have been dead within 30min. They told us that the concentration of carbon monoxide in his bedroom was the highest they had ever seen, 1000ppm, measured after the windows were opened. In the hospital, our oxygen saturation was found to be very low, and we were treated in hyperbaric oxygen chambers. We were discharged after about one day.What I find unusual about carbon monoxide poisoning is that my father and I had very different reactions. He is elderly and fell asleep very calmly, and also woke up much more disoriented and confused than I did. I, 25 at the time, was showing severe flu-like symptoms, and was waking up from sleep due to those symptoms. My understanding of the event is clearer than my fathers, and my memory of the event is more accurate. The reason the house filled with carbon monoxide is because there was a leak to the basement that corroded a hole into the furnace, which had been left on for an extended period. The batteries from the carbon monoxide detector were removed by the last tenant, likely because it was going off.  Embed Quote"

The house had a really old furnace used for heating and if you left it on for too long, you got CO poisoning. One night I got vigorously shaken awake; I was sitting down and I wasn't where I fell asleep. Our family friend told me that I got poisoned by gas to which I only said “I did what?” As I sat there, head aching, ears ringing and all, it slowly started sinking in… but it didn't have any gravity. It’s the same kind of feeling you get when you’re very sleep-deprived. Everything is really slow, except you no longer feel like a participant, you feel like a spectator. It’s the same feeling you get when you faint – you kind of “let go” and whatever happens to you feels really far away and irrelevant. Apparently our family friend woke up in the middle of the night and realised that she’d left the furnace on. She slept in a different part of the house so the gas didn't affect her. I guess that if she didn't randomly wake up that night, I wouldn't be answering this question today.  Embed Quote"

It is much easier to wash out a few hours of acute high level CO poisoning than weeks or months of repeated low level exposures.Good news is that MUSES and many other chronic symptoms of CO poisoning are easily tested, treated and reversed even years and decades after their initial poisoning.It might be difficult to find a doctor who already knows this, but hang in there and keep explaining.The appropriate test to confirm acute current or chronic past CO poisoning is not arterial OR venous carboxyhemoglobin (=COHb) but BOTH and from the same elbow or wrist.While acutely exposed to CO and for up to one hour thereafter:aCOHb>>vCOHbbecause more CO is going into your tissues than coming out.But after exposure ends, arterial COHb falls faster than venous and this gap flips. So in the ""chronic"" phase as more CO diffuses (very slowly) out of tissues:aCOHb < vCOHb.This abnormal unhealthy condition may last years or even decades unless and until properly treated.Arterial and venous CO levels and even the average level of CO in tissues can be measured non-invasively in exhaled breath using any (small and portable) professional CO detector that displays accurately from zero.You can do this at home--no doctor or lab is needed--but not with a home CO detector because they are both inaccurate and prohibited by UL and CSA stds from displaying below 30ppm (except in recall mode when they may show recorded peaks as low as 10ppm, which is still not low enough for breath analysis).So BEWARE if you have a home CO alarm --> when it displays ""O"" , the actual level may be anywhere from 0 to 29ppm. In contrast, the EPA avg. limit for outdoor exposure is only 9ppm.  Embed Quote"

Most electronics will have an impact on the environment. You have to consider the energy it takes to make the product, use the product, and recycle the product. Let's say that we can find a way to use all recyclable materials in a computer. The one in the link above is a good start. Energy and resources are still necessary to manufacture the computer. Now when you use the computer, you are using electricity, which is a resource. Now let's say we find a way to use a ""green"" energy source like solar power or wind power. That would lesson the impact. However, using the internet also takes resources. Think of all of the internet servers that run 24/7. That consumes a lot of energy. All of those consume a lot of energy. Last but not least, the recycling of a products uses energy as well. Machines are required to take apart and sort the materials, after all, and that requires energy.For the time being, the best thing to do is to reduce the amount of electronics you buy, and when you no longer want/ need something, donate it or take it to a recycler who will try to refurbish it. The company I work for, All Green Electronics Recycling (If you're curious, check out http://allgreenrecycling.com), refurbishes electronics whenever possible. If that is not possible, we'll break down and refurbish/ reuse individual parts. If that's not possible, we sort and break down the materials and send them back to manufacturers to be reused. So any steel we recover would be sent back to a steel manufacturer and so on. It does use resources and impact the environment, I won't deny that, but with our current technology, it is impossible to avoid doing so. Consider this though: More energy is typically required to manufacture a computer than to use it. And it actually is quite cost- and energy-efficient to refurbish computers. Plus it can help out someone who can't afford a brand-new computer.  Embed Quote"

Recyclability of a product is one  of many factors that have an impact on the environment. A product starts with mining of natural resources which has an impact on miners and the environment. Then it is manufactured which has an impact on factory workers and environment. Then it is distributed air, ship, and trucks that run on gasoline. Then it is sold and retail spaces have impact on environment. Then it is used and the energy it takes to run the device and servers has an impact on environment. And we still don't know if heavy use of these products have an impact on human health. Then all of this embodied energy is measured up against the durability of the product - how long it lasts. And finally we look at where the product goes when user throws it away. Often it goes to China were poor people disassemble it for precious metals and expose themselves to horrible toxins in the process. On the other hand, some are arguing that these devices enable wonderful social and educational benefits. And we don't know how to measure those against environmental impact. My hope is that an increase in the ubiquity of 3D printing will empower users to build and upgrade their own devices. If this happens, a lot of the product life cycle stuff that I mentioned before - manufacturing and distribution specifically - falls away.  Embed Quote"

I'm going to assume you're not a native English speaker though so I'll try to assume you're wondering if a lizard you saw is dangerous.For further identification it would help if you told me where you were from, but to answer your question, most lizards are NOT dangerous and their bite will NOT harm you. In fact, their first reaction towards you isn't to bite at all, but to flee. Lizards are very good for controlling bugs around your house and many can be quite friendly!The only lizard that presents any kind of severe danger to humans is the Komodo Dragon. They reach the length of a human and one bite will kill you, but they only live on a couple islands north of Australia. Other large lizards are capable of inflicting wounds if provoked, but none of them are fatal.So in summary, no, the lizard you saw is not dangerous :)  Embed Quote"

So, of course, this incident can't compare with accidents that caused large scale loss of human life, or massive destruction of nature. Still, there is something about it that resonated for me, when I saw this question.In 1964, a graduate student was given permission to study an ancient Bristlecone pine tree among a grove of such trees in what would later be designated Great Basin National Park, Nevada. The tree may have been as much as 5000 years old, but seems to have been definitely over 4000 years old. One of the oldest living organisms in the world. It's name was Prometheus.What exactly happened is disputed, but the Forrest Service seems to have given the student permission either to cut down the tree entirely, or cut sections from it. There may have been a failure  at the time to understand how old this particular tree was.  At any rate, ultimately, the entire tree was cut down and destroyed.Because the damage involved just one tree, to me it seems more stunning (or easier to grasp the tragedy of), somehow, than more widespread destruction.

This disaster was so prominent that many industrial safety regulations in the EU are named after it. * this is a common fate for many pesticides once used in the world and is by no means restricted to 2,4,5-T, though I have no idea of its toxicity relative to other banned substances; as toxicity data has gotten better and people's tolerance for toxins has become lower, many pesticides have been slowly restricted in use or banned completely. For another very recent example, look to ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate)s or EBDCs, a fungicide family which was recently banned in Europe  Embed Quote"

I don’t know how protective that is so  there’s two mechanisms there why a snake doesn’t poison itself.The cobra is apparently a special case, though.

They then administer a calculated dose of the substance being tested such that 100% of the sample population will die.They then take a second sample population of the same animals, and administer a somewhat lower dose, measuring what percentage of the population dies as a result.They keep diminishing the dose, administering to new sample populations of the target animal, until, several sample populations and hundreds of dead animals later, a particular dose kills 50% of the population.This dose is the Lethal Dose 50, or LD50.1. Have I understood the process correctly?2. What is the experimental justification behind this particular method?3. Why all the killing?4. What does this test tell us that we can't know by other means?","It has been said that the difference between a drug and a poison is dose. The point of establishing the LD50 is to find the therapeutic window which is the region in where you'll have the clinically desired result but not the clinically undesired effect.The knowledge of the EC50 is obvious. If you're not dosing the drug above the efficacious dose, you're not doing anything.You could try to figure out the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). However, it's rather difficult to measure in animal studies. Were the mice extra jumpy because of the side effect or because the food was a bit weird. You may have a guess at what the MTD is and when you go into clinical trials, you will never start at a concentration above that. However, if patients aren't getting the appropriate response, you may need to escalate the dosage pass the MTD.What are suitable alternatives? You could potentially run a Cytotoxicity assay. Won't tell you anything about harmful metabolites, blood related issues, cell-specific effects, transport errors, and clearance. Maybe a CYP450 panel? Doesn't even give you that much information asides an idea that the drug gets metabolized in a certain route.The LD50 is a clear endpoint. The animals either dies or it doesn't. You don't even need to kill 100% of the animals to figure out the answer. This information is incredibly valuable because while you're doing your dose escalation, you know that you should never ever come even close to the LD50 and if the science requires you to go anywhere remotely close to that point to get the clinical response you want, that's when you look at Go/No Go list and circle No Go. During the R phase, one can look at the ratio between the LD50/ED50 to establish a Therapeutic index. A large therapeutic index is a powerful indicator that you'll have a decent compound to start human trials. A small therapeutic index suggests that you'll have a narrow window and you'll be better off with a new lead.  Embed Quote"

Does this really need explanation?Rechargeable batteries are especially dangerous. Most of these rely on the unusual electrochemical properties of metals like nickel or cadmium or even mercury. Do any of these sound like a good idea to eat?The least dangerous in comparison are ""ordinary"" batteries or alkaline batteries, where the worst thing that could happen is you chew them and the acid gel or alkali gel corrodes soft tissue in your mouth and gullet and stomach lining. Or that the whole darn thing gets into your stomach and the strong acid of your stomach juices dissolves the plastic and metal casing and all that leaks out anyway.Also easily forgotten is that batteries - even when ""drained"" - contain a store of chemical energy. That is what they were built for! Now imagine if all that energy were suddenly released in a one fell swoop chemical reaction. That's right - major heat production. Now imagine suddenly applying lots of heat to soft tender inner organs. Also bad.In summary - eating a battery means a long and painful death by some combination of metal poisoning, chemical burns and sheer stupidity.  Embed Quote"

In humans they are present primarily as membrane associated proteins.They are located either in the inner membrane of mitochondria or in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells.Cytochromes P450 catalyze the addition of a single oxygen atom to the benzene ring forming benzene oxide which is an unstable epoxide which further reacts to give other biproducts .The biproducts of the reactions are toxic as they are not excreted readily and can interact with DNA to produce harmful mutationsThis explains why Benzene is toxic.Benzene despite being very stable undergoes metabolism because of the catalyst which forms a complex which is very stable.Thus the transition state is stabilized which lowers the energy of activation which now makes the reaction kinetically feasible  .Benzene oxide being a highly unstable epoxide immediately undergoes reaction to form several products such as quinones,phenols etc.Enzyme Catalysis in the liver cells**Cytochrome P450 is denotes as CYPMechanisms which have been commonly postulated as being responsible for benzene toxicity.Two mechanisms have been commonly postulated as being responsible for benzene toxicity. Initial biotransformation of benzene takes place primarily in the liver. Most models postulate that cytochromes P450 catalyze the addition of a single oxygen atom to the benzene ring forming benzene oxide. Some of the benzene oxide becomes conjugated to glutathione via glutathione-S-transferase (GST), forming a pre-phenyl mercapturic acid that is then further biotransformed to phenyl mercapturic acid. The remaining benzene oxide is conjectured to be removed by two main pathways. At high benzene doses, most benzene oxide spontaneously rearranges to form phenol. The rest is converted to dihydrodiol intermediates by epoxide hydrolase, which are then converted to catechol by dehydrogenases. A second path that could lead to catechol is addition by P450 of another oxygen atom to phenol. Alternatively, the second OH-group may be attached across the benzene ring from the first, creating hydroquinone. P450 may add another oxygen atom to catechol converting it to 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. Hydroquinone can be oxidized probably via a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction, to p-benzoquinone. Catechol and benzenoxide may also be converted to trans-trans muconaldehyde which involves an opening of the benzene ring. A detoxication product of trans-trans muconaldehyde is muconic acid.Other phase II conjugation pathways are also extremely important in benzene metabolism and toxicity: e.g. extensive glucuronidation and sulphation of phenols Sources:A Mechanistic Modeling Framework for Predicting Metabolic Interactions in Complex MixturesCox, 1991; Medeiros et al, 1997; Ross, 1996; Snyder and Hedli, 1996; Yardley-Jones et al, 1991).Cytochrome  Embed Quote"

Eventually your stomach would cool enough and the gas would slow and there would just be a steady flow of vapor escaping from your dead mouth.  Embed QuoteAnswered in seventeen minutes."

Liquid nitrogen would usually be stored in a pressurized container with thick walls. You can transfer a small quantity to a cup, but then most of it would evaporate even before it hits the cup. As soon as you try to take a sip, as it comes into contact with your lips and your tongue, it would evaporate at a very high rate and build up pressure in your mouth making it impossible to swallow. And btw, in case it does manage to touch your tongue, then it would make it brittle like wafers! So the next moment, you try to move your tongue, it would just shatter and break into pieces and fall!! Now this is as good as being dead. Somehow if you manage to swallow it, it would freeze your entire internal system and you'd be dead within seconds. And if you try to move, all your internal organs being brittle due to the extremely low temps, would crack and break like a biscuit.So the answer in short--- That's probably the last thing you'd ever do!  Embed Quote"

om/Toxicology-and-Poison?share=1,,"In Gordon's Bay Australia, I was stung by a box jellyfish whilst swimming alone in what initially appeared  to a beautiful deserted beach under a bright azure sky. The kind of day you want to write to someone about even on a post card.I must tell you something of the pain. The pain attacks your body at a speed that is so fast it cannot be measured. Already your lungs are paralyzed and your stomach is turned upside down. Simultaneously your tongue is trapped and quickly dries out, while your jaw slams shut and your eyes squeeze tight. Your ears go deaf. Your muscles tense in an attempt to combat the pain; then they release succumbing to its awesome power. Gravity informs your body that it is a force not to be taken for granted. Your heart strains too hard and so with the rest of your body. Every nerve ending alerts you, in the manner most suited to it, that you are being attacked. Only your consciousness works well, or well enough to remind that you are just alive. It always obeys pain. You make rash decisions as fear takes control. You miss your last allies: strength and hope as the neurotoxin enters the your body and introduces consciousness to absolute pain.Absolute pain is life's only true enemy. Only absolute pain can defeat life. It is clever and treacherous. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It attacks your blind spot, which it finds with infallible ease. It begins by sending a lightening strike through your entire body and then your mind after the damage has been done. One moment you are feeling calm, self-possessed, and happy. Then pain, without any disguise, commands your attention like you have never be called before. You don't even have time to make a  childish desperate prayer of ""please, please, please!"". However, disbelief tries to deny pain its authority. But disbelief is poorly armed and easily overpowered. Reason comes in an attempt to defend you; it hopes that by demanding what the cause of the pain is, it will overcome its awesome might. For less than a moment you are assured. Reason is fully equipped at dealing with almost everything; however, it is no competition in the face of pain. Pain is faster than the speed of light..there is nothing quicker than the awareness of the toxin in your body.  It wipes reason out of existence, and anything that finds itself in its path. The neurotoxin makes the matter difficult to put into words. For pain, real pain, takes away your foundation to think clearly as you are brought face to face with your maker; memory is destroyed as you are confined to that moment. A micro-second of absolute pain seems like an eternity. There are no words to accurately express the depth and breadth of pain.  It is beyond measurement, despite any scientists definition (who I can assure you have no experience of such pain). The least you can do to express the sensation is wince in silence, at best scream in agony. In my case, I screamed hoping my voice would chase the pain away.You are defeated without having the chance to put up a fight. It's almost impossible to swim, as a sense of calm courses through you body informing you to just breath in the warm water and the pain will go away.In desperation you look around you to see where the attack came from; but there were no signs of anything above the surface., because the Box Jellyfish is almost completely transparent in water and very delicate. A shrimp could easily pierce their body and consequently they have developed an exceptionally potent poison in order to prevent any foreign object penetrating them. The tentacles are armed with up to five thousand nematocysts, or stinging cells. Certain chemicals on the surface of fish, shellfish and humans activate these. The wound itself leaves a red line, tracking where the poison entered the skin and inflaming the area around it...in my case my foot was so swollen it looked like an inflatable foot..and in a short period of time the red line corrodes the skin and muscle underneath it, leaving just bone as a result of the hemotoxin.After a tremendous panic and flailing in the water, I reached the shore and walked 1 mile home and blindly sort refuge with a bag of peas on my couch in the loneliness of my apartment with faint notion of a rational thought that pain would realize it was an unwelcome guest. For forty eight hours of insanity and the fear of the continuous suffering I was then finally able to summon the strength to pick myself up and get to a hospital...(picture below is of a fatal sting and the box itself) To explain the notion of corrosion see the following linkhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hem...

A bit of a different experience to Mark, however still a good story :)We were staying on Langkawi Island in Malaysia at the end of 2010. On one afternoon we decided to go on a sunset cruise, one which has a net off the side of the boat so you can have a 'spa' as they call it in the very warm ocean water.After having a great time for about 15 minutes, I noticed I had been stung (three marks) on the abdomen (just above the hip). At first I thought it was just a normal sting, so the captain ran vinegar on it and I wasn't very worried (I was going to get back in the water). It stung a bit, but not more than a blue-bottle which sting us a fair bit in Australia (nb: I am Australian)Thirty minutes later and my back began cramping with excruciating pain. It started from my kidney area (back only at the start) and moved up to my neck. The pain felt like every muscle in my back was cramping and I could do nothing to release it. As the pain got worse, so did my mental state. I think of myself as a pretty pain-tolerant guy but this pain made me go very weird.I thought that I was going to die. I began screaming at the boat staff to get me to a hospital ASAP. Luckily, I managed to get on a speed boat back to the port and get taken immediately to a hospital. I think it's important to note that I wasn't intentionally doing any of this, the pain was so severe and my mental state so convinced my end was looming, I literally went crazy.After getting to the hospital, I had to walk some distance, and I noticed that as I walked it didn't feel 'better' but was less intense. My mental state was so fragile, that after being told by the Langkawi Doctor that ""there aren't any dangerous jellyfish in langkawi"" so we'll just ""give you a few injections"" I literally ran away from the hospital (when my girlfriend went to the bathroom). I was delirious and hallucinating as I ran away from the hospital and I still cannot explain why I was acting that way.So after I had run away from the hospital, we were driven back to my resort (Berjaya - the other end of Langkawi island!). I was still in excruciating pain, however, I was convinced I could 'fight it'. To cut a long story short, two hours later of rediculuous pain and still more weird behaviour I needed pain killers. So back to the hospital we went (another 30 min ride). This time my 'head' was back to normal and I had one anti histamine injection and two pain killing injections. The pain lessened a bit, but was still very sore. I was mentally and physically drained and asked to leave the hospital with some pain killing tablets.That night in bed, (6 hours after the sting and after the injections above) I was still very sore, but mentally I was 'back'. The next day I didn't move from bed (except for a failed 100m walk where I grew to exhausted to keep going) and the next day I managed to walk to the hotel's beach and lay on a daybed and read/sleep.For one month after the sting, I still had weird shooting pains in my back. So, that's what it was like for me being stung by a jellyfish. Not nice!  Embed Quote"

In this sense, organic food is inherently grown without chemical pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, etc. In addition, organic farmers promote complex interactions between plants, animals, and ecosystems that are not found on industrial farms, whether conventional or certified USDA organic. Such interactions may include utilizing rotational grazing instead of feeding grain to livestock, or using multiple crops in the same space instead of separating them. In short, this method of farming uses systemic, holistic approaches, rather than input substitution. Organic food in this sense is better for you and for the environment.Conversely, organic food may also refer to food labeled as such according to USDA standards, and whether this food is better is less obvious and can depend on the situation.For example, USDA organic certification mandates that cattle receive 30% of their diet from grazing. While their remaining diet may include certified organicgrain, cattle’s digestive systems evolved to process grass, and feeding themgrain causes health problems and results in beef that contains fewer nutrientsimportant to human health (such as vitamins and Omega 3 fatty acids). In thiscase, grass-fed beef may be better for you than organic beef.Another example involves non-certified organic polyculture as compared to certified organic monoculture. USDA organic standards allow monocultures, that is, large areas populated by a single crop type. Monoculture crops can produce a myriad of detrimental environmental effects, including stripping the soil of its nutrients (which can in turn result in less nutritious food), disrupting ecosystems, and jeopardizing biodiversity. Is organic monoculture better for the environment? Perhaps yes, if compared to conventional monoculture, and perhaps not, if compared to a non-certified polyculture that does not use chemical inputs.Farmers that practice organic agricultural methods in the first sense may choose to not certify their products as USDA organic for several reasons, including the cost of certification or disagreement over the value of USDA standards. I once met a dairy farmer who implemented many environmentally sustainable practices on his farm, but chose not to pursue certification because he thought it was cruel to not treat dairy cows with antibiotics when their udders were infected. USDA organic certification also does not address some important concepts in sustainable eating such as the nutritional and environmental costs of shipping food long distances, or the benefits of eating seasonally.While USDA organic certifications do not necessarily equate to healthier or moreenvironmentally friendly food, the standards are relatively new (the OrganicFoods Production Act passed in 1990) and are still being revised (amendments to the act including stricter standards on the treatment of livestock, among other things, will take effect this July). Several states and countries have organic certifications that differ from USDA standards, some of which attempt to more tightly embrace the emulation of natural plant and animal systems.Food may also be labeled according to other terms, such as “all natural”,“environmentally friendly”, or “Earth Friendly, Farm Friendly”. While theselabels may be accurate, they are not monitored or enforced by a governing body and there are no legally mandated national standards to which they must adhere. In fact, the “Earth Friendly, Farm Friendly” label is condoned by anorganization (the Center for Global Food Issues) partially funded by Monsanto that is anti-organic, and the Union of Concerned Scientists advises avoidingproducts with this label (according to their publication Earthwise).In sum, organic food is usually better for you and for the environment. However,in order to know for sure you must know the practices used when growing a particular food item, and because of ambiguous labeling this is often difficult.  Embed Quote"

[1]) - but in general, fruits from the Rosaceae family (apples, peaches, nectarines, and strawberries), have the highest levels of neurotoxic pesticide contamination. However, most non-organic vegetables (except celery) do not contain such dangerous pesticides, so they probably aren't much more risky.The Rosaceae trees are also sprayed with neurotoxic herbicides that the USDA doesn't even measure - like paraquat and ziram - see What crops are most likely to be contaminated with ziram? Or paraquat?I haven't found any studies on the negative effects on people who consume the fruits yet (they also depend on the extent to which exposure to pesticides in food contributes to blood levels of pesticides in food), but there are studies that have found neurotoxic effects in people who simply live near fields that have been sprayed with pesticides (listed below). In that case, until we learn more, there is definitely good reason to advise caution with eating non-organic fruit from the Rosaceae trees if you naturally eat a lot of fruit.I don't think that you should worry about an increased risk of cancer (see Are we exposed to more carcinogens now than any other time in history?) or decreased lifespan at all. But there is a risk that all the pesticide residue could make you dumber if you eat a lot of fruit (this is more relevant for vegetarians/vegans than for most others). Most pesticides are quite selective by acting on the nervous systems on the pests, so they naturally have selective effects when consumed by people too.Here is a list of pesticides in the most contaminated fruitApples: http://www.whatsonmyfood.org/foo...Nectarines: http://www.whatsonmyfood.org/foo...Peaches: http://www.whatsonmyfood.org/foo...Pears: http://www.whatsonmyfood.org/foo...Strawberries: http://www.whatsonmyfood.org/foo...Celery: http://www.whatsonmyfood.org/foo...Almonds: http://www.whatsonmyfood.org/foo...[1] Note that the EWG site should only be seen as a rough source, and is somewhat misleading, as it counts the total number of pesticides inside. In reality, many of the ""most contaminated"" vegetables actually contain a lot of the more benign pesticides like the neonicotinoids. Also, note that the neurotoxic organophosphate Azinphos methyl will be banned by the EPA in mid-2012.=====So what's up with some of the pesticides I mentioned? Some of them have nasty neurological effects that have been demonstrated in people who simply live near areas where pesticides are sprayed (effects such as significant increases in one's risk of Parkinson's Disease, and yes - even decreases in intelligence). Many of these effects are not effects that you can capture through mortality data in animal (or human studies), and were only discovered in the last few years, so any conclusions (prior to 2010) about the safety of such pesticides are now moot.Now, do these effects transfer to consumers? We don't know yet. But we *do* know that they *do* apply for people who simply *live* near areas where pesticides are sprayed. Also - you can't get rid of pesticides by washing your produce: http://www.reddit.com/r/askscien... . And the major route of exposure to organophosphates (in children) is through food (see http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/artic... )Keep in mind that humans are especially vulnerable to neurological effects (there aren't really any animals that naturally develop Alzheimer's or Parkinson's - so any neurotoxicity will be underreported in most animal studies, and completely glossed over in lifespan studies. They often develop plaques but with no clear evidence of mental decline). See http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/... and Are there any animals that don't get Alzheimer's Disease?With that said - I'm not totally sure if pesticides do that much damage to the brains of most people, give...

Sounds scary. But realistically? What's the objective measurement here? You need a lot more data to prove this is clinically significant. If the level at which harm is seen is X and children on organic diets have 0.2X and children on conventional diets have 0.4X, does it really matter? Can you even prove it's due to diet, not other factors? Another study showed that household use of pesticides, NOT diet, predicted urinary insecticide levels.One study actually showed that consumption of organic meat in winter was a risk factor for infection with Campylobacter bacteria. So...this meat is more expensive, and it might cause greater rate of infection? Where exactly is the so-called benefit of being organic here?6 studies ""found no consistent differences in plasma or urine carotenoids, polyphenols, vitamins E and C content, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, antioxidant activity, ability to protect against DNA damage, immune system markers, or semen quality between participants consuming organic and conventional diets"" Again, not seeing any real benefits of spending lots of money for the organic label here...151 studies reported that harvesting or processing methods were the same for both organic and conventional foods; the rest didn't actually describe harvesting or processing methods. I find it rather difficult to believe that in the studies that did not report these methods, they were significantly different; if they were, any researcher worth their salt would've realized it would be an awesome conclusion to report.""We did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products"" So...maybe shopping for organic food only doesn't necessarily enhance vitamin intake...?A few studies found that organic milk and chicken had higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. However, several studies showed that the season of sampling and brand affected these levels at LEAST as much as the farming method. Seriously, if you're that worried about omega-3 intake, you can get a year's supply for about $10 at Amazon or Costco. Much more cost-effective if you ask me.No difference in protein/fat between organic and conventional milk.Some studies showed higher levels of pesticide residues in conventional produce. Each study had a slightly different level of what was considered ""positive"", though. If you look at studies examining the prevalence of contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits, two studies showed no difference, and one actually showed 6% in organic vs. 2% in conventional...Prevalence of E. coli contamination in produce was 7% in organic vs. 6% in conventional. Of the 5 studies examining this, 4 showed higher risk for contamination among organic produce.""differences in the prevalence of bacterial contamination between organic and conventional animal products were statistically insignificant"" Interesting part: if you look at just pork, 65% of organic pork was contaminated with E. coli vs. 49% of conventional.""No significant differences were found in the ascorbic acid content of cabbage (3 studies), carrots (3 studies), potatoes (3 studies), or tomatoes (8 studies); beta-carotene content of tomatoes (3 studies); or protein content of wheat (6 studies) when grown organically versus conventionally.""I should note some of the problems with research in this field:Over half of studies don't actually list what on earth their standard for considering a product ""organic"" was. Why is this a problem? Well, European Union has one, many European countries have country-specific additional standards, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements has another, and the U.S. Dept of Agriculture has yet another. They all have slightly different requirements.Some papers have really, really small sample sizes. Like...only 6 study subjects. It's kind of impossible to rely on such a study for a generalized view of humanity.Some papers have really, really short time periods. Like...only 2 days. It's kind of impossible to rely on such a study for a generalized view of longitudinal health outcomes 10, 20, 30 years down the line.Data analyzing produce can come from specialized experimental farms, which can control for factors such as weather, geography, etc; however, almost a third came from commercial farms that have no control over these factors, which may affect study results.There are no long-term studies of populations subsisting more on either organic or conventional foods, isolating this difference as the only variable.

And it shouldn't need to be said that most of these people have either commercial or ideological motives for extolling the virtues of organic produce. Because of this, their claims about its supposedly superior taste and nutritional value, its lower environmental impact, and so on, should be treated with no less circumspection and objective skepticism than they encourage us to apply to the counter-claims of their non-organic opponents. While some of the claims of the organic lobby may contain a grain of truth, they might still not be true in all circumstances, without exception. And it is relativiely easy to cherry-pick one's data, selecting that which supports one's viewpiont and ignoring that which does not. All successful marketing campaigns employ the dark art of 'creative  statistics'. Other claims for the benefits of organic food are flatly contradicted by the available evidence, and one suspects that those who repeat them and believe them are simply doing so because they have become dogmas and articles of faith within the 'wholefood movement', and to question them is regarded as dangerously heretical. But we must not let profits and politics obscure hard scientific data. Take just a few such claims about organic food, already repeated on here: Firstly, that organic food is more nutritious than conventionally produced food:[The] London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine examined 162 papersthat compared organic and conventionally produced food. They concluded that there was no evidence to back up claims that organic food is more nutritious. http://www.newscientist.com/arti... (subscription required for full article, but the research cited is below)'Our review indicates that there is currently no evidence to support the selection of organically over conventionally produced foods on the basis of nutritional superiority.' - Alan Dangour, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine’s Nutrition and Public Health Intervention Research Unithttp://www.lshtm.ac.uk/news/2009...Secondly, that organic food carries less risk of bacterial or other contamination:Organic broiler chickens are three times as likely as conventionally-bred poultry to be contaminated with a bacterium that causes food-poisoning, say Danish vets. http://www.newscientist.com/arti...[By] shunning science, organic producers could be increasing consumers' risk of contracting Escherichia coli and other food-borne diseases....In theory, organic food could be more prone to microbial contamination due to the absence of preservatives and the use of manure as fertiliser....Studies carried out on organic and conventional produce by Minnesota farmers in 2004 found that E. coli contamination was 19 times greater on organic farms which used manure or compost less than 12 months old...Another extra risk factor in organic production is the avoidance of fungicides, which can lead to the growth of moulds and increased risk of mycotoxins such as aflatoxin and ergot in crops.http://www.newscientist.com/arti...Thirdly, that food irradiation is dangerous and degrades the nutritional value of foods: There is no evidence that food irradiation is harmful to consumers, and also no evidence that it affects the nutritional quality of food.See preceding link.Fourthly, that organic foods are inherently safer than conventionally produced foods because they are not treated with synthetic agrochemicals and additives:In contrast to the popular perception that chemical residues in food are the major source of food contamination, recent food-borne disease outbreaks have demonstrated that microbial hazards are much more significant for food safety (Cliver, 1999). The risks due to pesticide residues and food additives are relatively minor, compared with both acute and chronic effects caused by microbiological and other naturally occurring toxicants (Fig. 3) (Cliver, 1999). ... In the past decade, outbreaks of human diseases associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits, or unpasteurised products originating from them, have significantly increased in number (Beuchat & Ryu, 1997; Keene, 1999)....consumers’ demand of minimally processed foods has had an apparent adverse influence on food safety (Zink, 1997)....Furthermore, there is no evidence that toxic hazards such as pesticides have had a major impact on total cancer mortality (Fisher & Worth, 1995); populations with diets rich in fruits and vegetables have a substantially lower risk of many types of cancer (Centers for Disease Control, 1999), despite the use of synthetic agrochemicals in conventional farming. Hence, the benefits may outweigh the risks....But neither is the organic label a seal of food safety. Organic refers only to a product that has been produced in accordance with certain standards throughout the production, handling, processing and marketing stages; it does not refer to the characteristics and properties of the finished product. The asserted health benefits are impossible to quantify and do not seem, as yet, to compensate for the increased price. ....Summing up, no hard evidence currently exists to support or refute claims that organic food is healthier and safer than conventional food, or vice versa, and assertions of such kind are inappropriate and not justified....The main health-promoting properties of food, however, lie in their ability to provide the human organism with carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fibre and protective factors needed for growth, repair, reproduction, energy and good health. Plants produce these complex nutrients from water, air, soil and sunlight. How well they do so is under the influence of many environmental and genetic factors, and the type of agriculture is only one variable.- Faidon Magkos, Fotini Arvaniti and Antonis Zampelas, Laboratory of Nutrition and Clinical Dietetics, Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Harokopio Universityhttp://journals.cambridge.org/do...Regarding this last point, I recall reading about a scientist who was strongly pro-organic foods. [1][2]. He believed all the hype and propaganda put out by the wholefood industry, and set out to win the debate for organics by conducting research into the comparative toxicity of organic versus conventionally produced foods, with regard to the levels of carcinogens found in both, from either man-made or naturally occuring sources. The results he found shocked him, and completely reversed his previous beliefs: he discovered that organic foods contain many times (in some cases, thousands of times) more carcinogens than conventionally produced foods! He concluded that this was because the specific genetic varieties of crops chosen for organic agriculture are precisely those that produce the highest levels of natural fungicides, herbicides and pesticides, as these crops will be the most resistant to disease and infestation, and so produce the highest yields and least wastage from crop damage. The irony for organic farmers is that many of these naturally occurring substances are hugely more carcinogenic than the synthetic agrochemicals used in conventional agriculture!   Finally, this research article refutes many of the common claims made by proponents of organic food, particularly concerning claims that organic farming methods do not use any harmful chemicals (false) and are more 'sustainable' (false) and environmentally friendly (false). It makes interesting reading, and also contains an extensive list of references to related scientific ressearch:http://www.gene.ch/gentech/2001/...In summary, when you subtract all of the ideological rhetoric and commercial self-interest that currently distorts their arguments, the claims of organic proponents that 'organic is best' simply don't stand up to impartial scientific scrutiny. This doesn't mean that conventionally produced food is any safer or healthier (though some would argue that it is, at least in some cases). It simply means that organic food has yet to be proven superior in these respects. So continue to consume organic food if you want to, and if you can afford its typically higher prices (though many poorer people cannot, which is probably why organic food consumption has become something of a status symbol of the middle-classes in recent years). I'm willing to concede that some of it may even taste nicer than the conventional alternatives, though there is research that also refutes such claims.(Taste is subjective, of course, and I also wonder how much of this is psychological, with people convincing themselves that it tastes better simply because they have a pre-conceived belief that it should.) Just don't fool yourself into believing that it is any healthier or safer for you, because the jury is still out.[1] I have been wracking my brain to recall his name, so far to no avail, but his research is quite famous. Can anyone help?[2] I'm not sure if this is the same guy, but his research has uncovered more-or-less the same facts: http://texasbot.tripod.com/lovej...  Embed Quote"

Outside of the the US and Canada, some organic certification processes may be dubious. 
  
 Katie is also correct that few long term studies show a nutritional benefit to organic products. But the studies showing the environmental benefits grows stronger each day. 
  
 My general rules of thumb are:
 Buy products grown in season, which tend to have the most time to have accumulated nutrients and is usually also grown closer to home. 
  
 If you can find local and certified organic, bonus! I love supporting my local farmer and his family's health. 
  
 From a nutrition point of view, cook vegetables as minimally as possible and save any cooking fluid for soup. 
  
 Try and have as many colours of the rainbow on your plate from veggies and fruit which will increase the likelihood of an array of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. 
  
 Regardless of organic or not, use good food safe sanitation practices at all times.  Embed Quote"

Can you get all the pesticide residues out of your non-organic carrot, even if studies claim the nutritional quality matches organic? And what of other factors like freshness? Non organic veg straight from the field of a neighbouring farm is likely to have a lot more vitamins in it than something organic that has been kicking around in the retail system for days on end. But like for like, organic is surely the best.  Embed Quote"

What follows comes from the Organic Consumers Association:Beyond Frankenfoods and Toxics: OCA’s Ten Reasons to Buy OrganicOrganic foods and products are the fastest growing items in America's grocery carts. Thirty million households, comprising 75 million people, are now buying organic foods, clothing, body care, supplements, pet food, and other products on a regular basis. Fifty-six percent of U.S. consumers say they prefer organic foods.Here are 10 reasons why you should buy organic foods and products:1. Organic foods are produced without the use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Consumers worry about untested and unlabeled genetically modified food ingredients in common supermarket items. Genetically engineered ingredients are now found in 75% of all non-organic U.S. processed foods, even in many products labeled or advertised as “natural.” In addition the overwhelming majority of non-organic meat, dairy, and eggs are derived from animals reared on a steady diet of GM animal feed. Although polls indicate that 90% of Americans want labels on gene-altered foods, government and industry adamantly refuse to respect consumers’ right to know, understanding quite well that health and environmental-minded shoppers will avoid foods with a GMO label.2. Organic foods are safe and pure. Organic farming prohibits the use of toxic pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones, nano-particles, and climate-destabilizing chemical fertilizers. Consumers worry about pesticide and drug residues routinely found in non-organic produce, processed foods, and animal products. Consumer Reports has found that 77% of non-organic produce items in the average supermarket contain pesticide residues. The beef industry has acknowledged that 94% of all U.S. beef cattle have hormone implants, which are banned in Europe as a cancer hazard. Approximately 10% of all U.S. dairy cows are injected with Monsanto and Elanco’s controversial genetically engineered Bovine Growth Hormone, banned in most industrialized nations. Recent studies indicate that an alarming percentage of non-organic U.S. meat contains dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria.3. Organic foods and farming are climate-friendly. Citizens are increasingly concerned about climate-destabilizing greenhouse gas pollution (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide), 35-50% of which in North America comes from our energy-intensive, chemical-intensive food and farming system. Organic farms and ranches, on the other hand, use far less fossil fuel and can safely sequester large amounts of CO2 in the soil (up to 7,000 pounds of CO2 per acre per year, every year.) Twenty-four billion pounds of chemical fertilizers applied on non-organic farms in the U.S. every year not only pollute our drinking water and create enormous dead zones in the oceans; but also release enormous amounts of nitrous oxide, a super potent, climate-destabilizing greenhouse gas.4. Organic food certification prohibits nuclear irradiation. Consumers are justifiably alarmed about irradiating food with nuclear waste or electron beams, which destroy vitamins and nutrients and produce cancer-causing chemicals such as benzene and formaldehyde. The nuclear industry, large food processors, and slaughterhouses continue to lobby Congress to remove required labels from irradiated foods and replace these with misleading labels that use the term ""cold pasteurization."" The USDA and large meat companies have promoted the use of irradiated meat in school lunches and senior citizen facilities. Many non-organic spices contain irradiated ingredients.5. Consumers worry about rampant e-coli, salmonella, campylobacter, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and fecal contamination in animal products coming out of the nation’s inhumane and filthy slaughterhouses. The Centers for Disease Control have admitted that up to 76 million Americans suffer from food poisoning every year. Very few cases of food poisoning have ever been linked to organic farms or food processors.6. Consumers are concerned about billions of pounds of toxic municipal sewage sludge dumped as “fertilizer” on 140,000 of America’s chemical farms. Scientific evidence has confirmed that municipal sewage sludge contains hundreds of dangerous pathogens, toxic heavy metals, flame-retardants, endocrine disruptors, carcinogens, pharmaceutical drugs and other hazardous chemicals coming from residential drains, storm water runoff, hospitals, and industrial plants. Organic farming categorically prohibits the use of sewage sludge.7. Consumers worry about the routine practice of grinding up slaughterhouse waste and feeding this offal and blood back to other animals, a practice that has given rise to a form of human mad-cow disease called CJD, often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. Animals on organic farms cannot be fed slaughterhouse waste, manure, or blood—daily rations on America’s factory farms.8. Consumers care about the humane treatment of animals. Organic farming prohibits intensive confinement and mutilation (debeaking, cutting off tails, etc.) of farm animals. In addition to the cruel and unhealthy confinement of animals on factory farms, scientists warn that these CAFOs (Confined Animal Feeding Operations) produce enormous volumes of manure and urine, which not only pollute surface and ground water, but also emit large quantities of methane, a powerful climate-destabilizing greenhouse gas.9. Consumers are concerned about purchasing foods with high nutritional value. Organic foods are nutritionally dense compared to foods produced with toxic chemicals, chemical fertilizers, and GMO seeds. Studies show that organic foods contain more vitamins, cancer-fighting anti-oxidants, and important trace minerals.10. Consumers care about preserving America’s family farms, world hunger, and the plight of the world’s two billion small farmers. Just about the only small farmers who stand a chance of making decent living these days are organic farmers, who get a better price for their products. In addition study after study has shown that small organic farms in the developing world produce twice as much food per acre as chemical and GMO farms, while using far less fossil fuel and sequestering large amounts of excess CO2 in the soil. Yields on organic farms in the industrialized world are comparable to the yields on chemical and GMO farms, with the important qualification that organic farms far out-produce chemical farms under extreme weather conditions of drought or torrential rains. Of course given accelerated climate change, extreme weather is fast becoming the norm.For all these reasons, millions of American consumers are turning to organic foods and other organic items, including clothing and body care products--part of an overall movement toward healthy living, preserving the environment, and reversing global warming.http://www.commondreams.org/view...  Embed Quote"

When eating organic fruits and vegetables, the amount of pesticide residue is dramatically reduced and when eating organic meat, you are not running the risk of ingesting growth hormone or antibiotics.                                                     For more Health and Fitness Tips Follow me on Twitter @JackKenefick or on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/OrangeC....

The carcinogenicity of epoxides originates from the strained nature of the three membered ring. Due to the number of electrons (6) in the valence shell, oxygen prefers to bond with two partners to achieve a full octet. Oxygen also has two lone pairs of electrons. A normal atom bonded to four entities typically assumes a tetrahedral geometry that minimizes repulsion of each moiety by maximizing the angle between them (109.5°). The two highly repulsive lone pairs of oxygen, however, push the two oxygen-bonded atoms together, distorting the tetrahedral geometry. For example, the H-O-H bond angle of water is a smaller 104.5°. The C-O-C bond angle of an epoxide, however, is even smaller at 61.5°. This highly non-ideal angle arises due to the additional constraint of the C-C bond length. The incredible strain on the epoxide ring reduces the stability of the molecule. Through reacting with other molecules, epoxides can relieve the strain and thus achieve greater stability. This reactivity can wreak havoc in a biological system, where processes compatible with life often require controlled changes to molecular structures. Let's look at a common example. The pro-carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene, a major mutagen in cigarette smoke, becomes metabolized by the body's P450 system to produce a carcinogenic epoxide:Once formed, the carcinogen tends to intercalate into DNA (the aromatic region  can Pi stack with the nitrogenous bases) and react at the epoxide region to form a covalent bond at guanines. This inclusion distorts the structure of DNA, causing errors in DNA replication (G --> T transversion). If these mutations occur in a gene encoding a molecule regulating the cell cycle, cancer may arise. All images taken from Wikipedia.  Embed Quote"

Let's start with that and move down the line.Corn is a very starchy grain. Starches are, in essence, nothing but very long strands of the same molecules that, when shorter, are known as sugars.Two so-called polysaccharides, amylopectin and amylose, are mostly important to us. Here's some small imagery to look at:AmyloseAmylopectin.Corn syrup is made by milling yellow corn and creating a starchy paste. That paste is then injected with α-amylase which breaks the starch (loooong chain of saccharides, remember) into shorter strands called oligosaccharides. Oligosaccharides have somewhere in the ten sugar molecules in a row.Next those oligosaccharides are injected with glucoamylase. That turns the oligosaccharide into maltose by breaking it into even smaller links. Still we have precisely the same stuff in the mix, only broken into smaller links. Here's the so-called ß-maltose:Looks familiar? Should, it's just a smaller, broken off, part of the Amylopectin. And here's 4-O-α-D-Glucopyranosyl-D-glucose, also a maltose:Looks familiar, too? Should, it's just a shorter version of Amylose.NOW it gets interesting. What you have right now is Corn Syrup. That's the stuff they put into all the candy because the loose -OH you see dangling there has a curious love for this:β-D-fructofuranulosyl-(2→1)-α-D-glucopyranoside. Also known as ""table sugar"". Chemically table sugar is 1 part glucose (the stuff you see linked above) and 1 part fructose. Because two sugars, fructose and glucose, are involved we call those things ""disaccharides"".So, from starch (a polysaccharide) to oligosaccharides, to maltose, to a disaccharide and then back with another disaccharide, and that's the stuff you get in candy. It makes candy either hard or soft, either very sweet or tart, depending on how you mix, form, and work it. It's very useful.Why's that stuff bad? For the same reason a cup of sugar, eaten with a spoon, would be bad. It's lots of carbohydrates and that's not good for you, simple.Now, what people cry about, however, isn't Corn Syrup. It's the so-called ""High Fructose Corn Syrup"".Let's go back to the maltose. And let's have a look at Glucose:If you tilt your head, squint, and relax your eyes you will see a schooner (it's not a sailboat). If you tilt your head the other way you see... 1/2 maltose.Imagine, though, you were to add an enzyme to the maltose above. Consider further that it's Xylose isomerase and does something that is best written down in a non-scientific way as D-xylose <-> D-xylulose. Makes sense? No? That's cool, all you need to know is that the stuff above (not the schooner, the 1/2 maltose) turns into this:It's more or less a game of chemical musical chairs and by winning one H and kicking the dude in the head who tried to sit down before the end of the song we gain ... fructose.Fructose, like glucose, is a so-called mono-saccharide. In table sugar (look back up if you forgot how it looks) one glucose and one fructose are married to each other. That's the republican option, no same-molecule marriages here. So when you chomp into something with table sugar in it, say a nice piece of cake, you chomp into 50% glucose and 50% fructose.In ""high fructose"" corn syrup, however, more glucose molecules become fructose than stay glucose. About five percent for the food stuff, up to 45 percent for other uses. HFCS55, therefore, has 45 percent glucose and 55 percent fructose.Why is THAT bad, you ask? Glad you did. Some very disputed studies claim that fructose is worse than glucose because it triggers a different insulin response (search my answers for links that debunk this claim for what it is - unscientific).But what really makes HFCS bad is its ubiquity. When you eat a cup of sugar or a bag of gummy bears you more or less know what you're getting yourself into. With bread, yogurt, beer, fruit salads, sausages, lunch meats, or similar you don't expect to eat the equivalent of a quarter cup of the crystalline stuff. Yet, sadly, you do. HFCS alone is not proven to be bad for you. It being in everything, however, makes for a bad diet.  Embed Quote"

First off, let's discuss the toxicity of sucralose. According to an Australian Commonwealth study, the LD50 (the dosage at which bolus administration of the given drug is deadly to 50% of the subjects) is upwards of 16,000 (mg of splenda)/(kg body weight * day). In other words, if I weigh 150lbs, ~68kg, my LD50 would be around 16000*68 = 1088000 mg/day of sucralose, or 1.088 KILOGRAMS of sucralose per day. Granted, this is based off of rat data, but their physiology is close enough for me to draw a correlation [1].The standard package of Splenda contains about 1 gram of the active ingredients (I'll negate the content of preservatives, perhaps some real sugar, etc) [2]. Extrapolating from the numbers above: I would need to consume roughly 1.09 thousand packets of Splenda before I was at a 50% risk of dying. Of course, those numbers are based off of rats, and it's entirely likely that the amount of sucralose in a given packet of Splenda is actually less than 1 gram. The point is, small amounts of Splenda are not toxic. Ok, that said, there are a few biochemical issues I should address. 1) You don't absorb much of the sucralose (as with any other 'fake' sugar) - generally 20-30%, which is less than a quarter of the compound [3]. The most obvious result of this is that sucralose is a diarrhetic: it pulls water from your blood so that it can be complexed within the lumen of the small/large intestines. Caffeine has a similar effect. Just be sure to drink some water after you've had your coffee and you should be fine on this note.Secondly, the molecules that do get absorbed are mostly excreted from the blood via the kidneys. This leaves very little of the active ingredient in your bloodstream to actually affect a response. If we look at the makeup of sucralose versus sucrose (natural sugar), we see that the chloride groups impede the sugar's ability to bind and function as other sugars do:Sucrose, versusSucraloseNotice the structure is structurally identical, but chemically different. This is the main reason why, even if absorbed, the sucralose doesn't do much. However, because there are so many hydroxyl groups (-OH), there are likely a few bacteria in our GI tract that would try to metabolize the compound. In general, if the bacteria is somehow successful, you end up with potentially toxic metabolites, but so few and in such dilute concentration that they are likely lost via excretion (urine or feces). I couldn't find any proof of this, as it is extremely unlikely, but should a certain bacteria see enough of the compound (sucralose), it's possible that a few strains of that given bacteria with a mutant active site can actually break down the compound. This would likely be toxic to the bacteria, possibly causing a bit of GI distress, such as bloody stool, if the bateria lyses itself and causes an inflammatory response. I do want to state again that this is very unlikely, and I have no proof; just pure speculation.EDIT: Thanks to Ben Stortz for keeping me honest - I screwed up a few of my numbers.

Diet, nutritional supplements, sleep, stretching, meditating, etc.","This is a very broad question because the endocrine system is only partially interconnected and the interaction between endocrine organs is complex. This is kind of what you are looking at:the endocrine systemA lot of control is exerted by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. The pituitary releases hormones into the circulation that regulate other endocrine organs like the thyroid, adrenal glands and also growth hormone and ADH (important for fluid balance). There are some broad recommendations that can be made for endocrine health.1. Adequate sleep. Chronic sleep loss affects growth hormone secretion, thyroid function, and adrenal secretion of cortisol. This also decreases leptin production. Leptin is a hormone released by fat cells that suppresses the appetite. Chronic sleep deprivation is related to weight gain, glucose intolerance, and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.Medscape Log In2. Avoid being overweight. This leads to insulin resistance and the pancreas has to make and release more insulin to lower blood sugar. This leads to type 2 diabetes and also a higher risk of cancer because insulin is a growth promoter.National Cancer Institute3. Exercise. This should include resistance exercises to increase muscle mass. Increased muscle mass lowers insulin resistance and lowers insulin levels. It's all good.Muscle Mass Knocks Out Insulin Resistance4. Diet. There's a lot of stuff out there about diet or supplements and the endocrine system and I'm not sure how much of it is valid. A lot of it sounds pretty kooky. Certainly, having iodine in the diet is needed for thyroid health. Iodine is necessary for adequate production of thyroid hormones that exert important control over metabolism. In America, iodine was added to salt, starting in the early 1900's because there was iodine deficiency causing goiter and thyroid dysfunction. In other parts of the world, iodine deficiency is associated with poor growth and mental retardation. Otherwise, it's hard to separate dietary confounding variables from weight and exercise. For example, people who drink a lot of alcohol and eat a lot of meat also tend to be overweight and more sedentary. Rather than recommending that certain foods be avoided, it may be more reasonable to recommend avoiding obesity and to have a diet that includes daily fresh fruits and vegetables.  Embed QuoteThis answer is not a substitute for professional medical advic...

One must eat a balanced diet (ref Old and New Food Pyramid with Pictures), eat regularly, avoid too much of fasting & feasting; exessive reliance on alcohol & tobacco.2. One must ensure regular (at least 5 days in a week) and effective (30 minutes each day - something that tires you) exercise - a mix of aerobic and weights with some time spent on stretches.3. A Relaxed mind - among 3 legs of healthy lifestyle, stress control is most important. Hypothalamus (in the brain) and Pituitary control the endocrine system. Enough, refreshing sleep (upto 8 hours each night) is a must for a relaxed mind and body.Ref: Lack of Energy: Could That Be One of Your Adrenal Fatigue Symptoms? The entire stress chemistry (see below) also begins in the hypothalamus when the body identifies a threat (real or imagined). Stress management, negative thought stopping & relaxation techniques are much more important that the earlier two.Now, few important, specific endocrine problems:1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - The importance of healthy Lifestyles can not emphasized more when it comes to Diabetes. Those who do not pay attention to diet, exercise and stress management end up with gradually increasing medicine doses.2. Hypothyroidism - exercise is very important.3. Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome - closely linked to the above mentioned both hence maintaining healthy lifestyle (esp diet & exercise) go a long way in weight management and controlling symptoms4. Hyperthyroidism - In addition to the common ones, cabbage is to be avoided as it is a goitrogen.5. Osteoporosis - if severe (as compared to age and co-morbidities) Parathormone is evaluated.

Other organisms might produce things like acetone alongside the butanols.Historically, a good reason that this wasn't the case is probably also that most of the organisms that produce propanols, butanols and other diols in significant quantity are obligate anaerobes.  They die upon exposure to oxygen, so there is very little chance that they might have been domesticated in the same way as sourdough mothers, yogurt lactobacilli, bakers and brewer's yeasts or ginger bugs might have - there's simply no way to handle them without relatively precise equipment not available before early modern times.  Even their spores would die exposed to open air.  When you consider that a great deal of the wine and beer in the old days soured due to impingement of air and the consequent growth of acetogens, it should be pretty obvious that old fermentation vessels would not be able to support obligate anaerobes.  Embed Quote"

Immunity typically refers to the development of antibodies specific to a particular pathogen. However, there is no such thing as an antibody for most chemicals (generally those that do not appear as antigens on pathogenic organisms or viruses). In fact, many chemicals tend to bioaccumlate; that is, your body does not readily excrete them. Repeatedly taking small does of such a chemical--like lead or DDT, for example--will actually deliver a rather large cumulative dose that could be lethal.To extend the example, being periodically exposed to specific antigens could induce immunity (some vaccines work in similar ways), but being periodically exposed to most chemicals would not.For more details about the actual nature of immunity, the Wikipedia article is pretty good (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imm....  Embed Quote"

Her constant barracking led to a moments inattention.

The related compound 2-octyl cyanoacrylate is a medical grade glue; it was developed to be non-toxic and less irritating to skin tissue. Cyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known as instant glues. The abbreviation CA is commonly used for industrial grades. (1)While they can be effective in closing very superficial wounds under low tension (meaning the wound edges do not tend to pull apart), super glues can also irritate tissues. The wound strength of acrylate glue-closed wound on day one is only 10-15% of a suture-closed wound. Super glue is also more likely to become brittle and fracture particularly in areas of higher tension. (2)The 2-octyl cyanoacrylate  was formulated to correct some super glue deficiencies as wound closure material, It is less reactive than the other super glues and degrades slower, making it less irritating.When implanted in deeper skin tissues, all super glues can cause inflammation, tissue necrosis, granulation (excess formation of blood vessels that actually impedes wound healing) formation and wound breakdown.The problem with Dermabond vs Krazy Glue is the price:  Dermabond costs over $20 per one time vial, whereas Krazy Glue is approximately $2-3.References:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cya...http://emedicine.medscape.com/ar...  Embed QuoteVia  David Urquhart."

Similarly, stringed-instrument players can form protective finger caps (in addition to calluses) with cyanoacrylates.CA glue was in veterinary use for mending bone, hide, and tortoise shell by at least the early 1970s. The inventor of cyanoacrylates, Harry Coover, said in 1966 that a CA spray was used in the Vietnam War to retard bleeding in wounded soldiers until they could be brought to a hospital. Butyl cyanoacrylate has been used medically since the 1970s outside the US, but, due to its potential to irritate the skin, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not approve its use as a medical adhesive until 1998 with Dermabond. Research has demonstrated the use of cyanoacrylate in wound closure as being safer and more functional than traditional suturing (stitches). The adhesive has demonstrated superior performance in the time required to close a wound, incidence of infection (suture canals through the skin's epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous fat layers introduce extra routes of contamination), and final cosmetic appearance.:""  Embed Quote"

""Toxic"" in general usage could be anywhere on the spectrum of real poisonous character. Water can be a deadly substance in sufficient dosage. A better rubric is the LD50, or median lethal dose, of a substance. LD50 is defined as ""the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration"" [1] A really poisonous substance, such as ricin, has a really low LD50 (22 µg/kg if injected) [1]. A very safe substance, such as water, has a very high LD50 (90,000 mg/kg in this case) [1].So, guidelines on what is considered ""toxic"" are somewhat subjective. It's generally accepted that a substance is toxic if its LD50 is below 2,500 mg/kg when consumed orally [2]. Since we're talking about sugar here, inhalation and skin exposure aren't of concern.Sugar comes in various forms. Table sugar is sucrose, whose LD50 is 29,700 mg/kg [1], far above the 2,500 mg/kg threshold for toxicity. The NYT article mentions high-fructose corn syrup, which in sodas is usually 55% fructose and 42% glucose [3]. The LD50 for fructose and glucose is 25,800 mg/kg [4,5], so high that it's not reported on most toxicity reports for those substances.So, no. All qualitative assessments and voluntary health concerns aside, sugar cannot be considered toxic by any stretch of the imagination.References:1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Med...2. http://www.ehs.uci.edu/programs/...3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hig...4. http://kcp.pdn.ipublishcentral.c...5. http://www.tradezone.com/tradesi...  Embed Quote"

Sugar can only be viewed as ""toxic"" in the same light as oxygen can be viewed as ""toxic"". Both serve much more important benefits which outweigh risks of overdosing. Sugar is held together by glycosidic bonds, each of which is easily hydrolyzed in the presence of a single water molecule to release individual glucose (or glucose + fructose in the case of table sugar) molecules, all of which are easily converted into energy and valuable metabolic intermediates within the body by key enzymes. Any undergraduate student who has taken a general biology course in today's day and age would have covered Glycolysis, the process I summarized above. Furthermore, glucose being a water-soluble molecule makes it very hard to overdose on (I can only imagine this happening through a super concentrated IV injection, which would kill you based on a rapid change in cellular hypotonicity before any actual ""poisoning"" results). To put it in basic terms, if you take in more glucose, you will pee more out. Or maybe your body will convert some to fat. Of course, if you have some type of chronic metabolic malfunction, perhaps the situation will change for you. But the problem here lies within your body, not within the way a normal person reacts to sugar.Breathing in atmospheric oxygen results in oxidation within the body. Does that make you want to stop breathing? Glucose is the primary energy source that fuels a human brain. I suspect some of the people who have answered before me , especially saying things such as ""sugar is toxic in the same way cigarettes are"", more than likely could use a little more glucose in their brains, or perhaps an updated undergraduate-level education in a science, before confusing the Quora community with such garbage.Now for a caveat: binge-consumption of sugar on a consistent basis will eventually start messing with your body's glucose-regulation, which is a very complicated hormonal-controlled mechanism. Throwing this off at a large enough degree will result in serious health problems. My credentials: I am doing my doctorate research in a lab which is funded by the American Diabetes Association, and we probe the metabolic regulation of blood glucose on a daily basis. I study all these hormones and receptors.  Embed Quote"

So yes sugar is toxic, not in the same way that arsenic is, it won't kill you immediately but over time it will cause a lot of ill health and death due to diseases that might not directly be attributed to sugar.

was a sunny Sunday morning in the summertime of 2006 in Redwood City, California, and the Mrs. was back East with her gal pals for a weekend of recharging her batteries and reconnecting with old friends.I was holding down the fort with the munchkins (boys 4 and 1 3/4), and in the interest of creating a morning diversion, we began to make preparations for a walk in the local hills.  Sunscreen on, snacks loaded, water filled, stroller out - you know the drill.I grabbed a pair of old shoes from the garage, and hastily threw them on over my bare feet, and continued my charge around the house to build momentum to get out the door.  About a minute later, I realized that there was some wiggling in the toes of my right shoe, and just as I was about to take my shoe off, I felt a prick on the tip the 2nd toe of my right foot - not painful, but it got my attention.I took my shoe off on the outside steps, and dumped it out, discovering a jet black inky spider with a body the size of an engorged pea.  I instructed my son to grab his bug-catcher which was conveniently nearby, and I dumped the spider into the clear container for inspection.Imagine my horror when I rotated the container and got a glimpse of a distinct reddish/brown hourglass figure on the belly of the black black spider.  OK, I reasoned, I'd lived in those parts for the better part of nearly 4 decades, and I'd NEVER heard of anyone seeing (let alone getting bit by) a black widow spider, so presumably this is just a copy-cat spider that is harmless.Well, I suppose before heading out for a walk, I ought to be safe and call the urgent care and see what they think. After being reassured that there was ""no way"" I had been bitten by a black widow, the attending physician confessed that she was looking at information on Google (!!!) and started to ask me questions about what it looked like.After 20 minutes on the phone (with the boys starting to melt down), and getting on the Internet myself, I began to experience my first tell-tale symptom -- a slight cramping in my lower right leg.At this point, the doctor changed position entirely, and strongly recommended that I get medical attention immediately.OK, kids, time to pile into the wagon.  We're heading to the ER.Ten minutes later, I walked through the doors at the ER at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, CA, with holding the hands of my two boys, along with the bug catcher.""30 minutes ago, THIS spider, bit me on THIS toe, and now THIS leg is cramping.""The otherwise bored doctors and nurses who were numbed by their predictable flow of blunt trauma, heart palpitations, and other mundane dramas rapidly appeared out of the woodworks and collectively shouted a big ""Yah!!!"".  This, they thought, was soooo cool.Note: Capturing and bringing in the actual spider was by far the smartest thing I did all day, as it brought me instant celebrity and credibility, as the bite itself was completely and somewhat disappointingly unremarkable.It was delicately but firmly suggested that I make some phone calls and line up some child-care, as soon I'd be all jacked up full of morphine and other things that would make me a less-than effective father.I was able to get ahold of my neighbor friends, who gamely dropped what they were doing, and came to pick up my boys.  We had a long discussion about how to orchestrate the movement of cars and carseats, including me driving their car home, which was completely naive given how F-d up I was about to become.By now the cramping had migrated into my groin area, and I was beginning to wonder what was in store.  I was told that an anti-venom does indeed exist, but it's kept in Arizona, and is highly toxic in and of itself, so they don't fly that in unless I was otherwise at risk (toddler, elderly, poor immune system).  So, my fate was to get jacked up on opiates and survive the onslaught of the neurotoxin from the spider which would otherwise cause tremendous pain and cramping for the next 6 hours.At this point I texted (SMS) my wife (who was on her way to the airport to come home from Boston): ""Hey there. I'm in the ER.  Got bitten by a black widow.  Love ya.""  So much for a relaxing end to her fun getaway.Several hours of mental bliss later, I was discharged from the ER, and picked up by my Dad, who took me to the pharmacy to pick up my meds (vicodin for pain, muscle relaxants). I was slurring words, and otherwise out of it, and happy to get home to relax.The next 48 hours were literally a blur.  I barely remember any of that time, and mentally, lost track of days and hours.  It freaked my wife out when I said I thought my Mom had spent the night so I guess I was hallucinating.We assumed at the time, that the meds were the culprit, but now later, we're pretty sure the delerium was a byproduct of the neurotoxins.The medical literature suggests that recovery happens within 3 to 5 days.  Nights 3 and 4 and 5 were complete disasters for me.  For some completely unknown reason, I was sweating profusely at night.  As in, literally soaking through my sheets and changing my sheets 3 times on one night and twice the next.  Wet, not damp.Specifically, I was leaking sweat out of my legs.  I'd wipe them off, and they'd bead up immediately.  It was freaky, to say the least.Also, I was having trouble concentrating, or being coherent for up to 5 days.  Sleep was next to impossible, and I was getting worn down. I later learned my wife was doing her own Google searches to see what the risks were of permanent brain damage. And, I think my life insurance was promptly renewed shortly thereafter.The doctors switched me over from vicodin to valium (one makes the pain go away, one makes you not care about the pain).  Finally, I got a decent night sleep on Thursday, and a good one on Friday.  I awoke on Saturday morning (Day 6) feeling like a human being for the first time, and proceeded to clean the garage like a freakin' maniac.Upon further inspection of my shoe in question, I discovered that the spider was harboring an egg sac inside my shoe.  How rude of me to put my foot in there.  She was actually quite restrained in waiting so long to bite me, and it turns out that these deadly creatures are incredibly passive.  This is why it's so rare that a bite happens, as in fact, I discovered, these spiders are everywhere in the area where I was living.If this happens to you, hang in there, and ride it out.  You will get better, but it takes some time.When I returned to work, my co-workers had decorated my cubicle with all sorts of Spiderman memorabilia and delighted in my misery.  All in good fun.  Embed Quote"

ten years ago I was cleaning out a storage shed. I had reached in behind a door frame and felt something bite. I pulled my arm out and saw the spider still on my arm. I dropped her in a mason jar to take her with me to the ER and went inside to call my wife. I did a little research on what to expect and figured that I had a couple of hours before I started exhibiting symtoms so we went out for dinner. I was fine during dinner. The site of the bite was slightly red and the weirdest thing was that in a ring around the bite about 1.5 inches across my skin was sweating. No where else but that little area. I was starting to have cramping in my stomach by the time we checked into the ER. The nurses/Dr.s were pretty skeptical about my diagnosis until I produced the spider. They told me that while anti-venom did exist, the side effects were worse than what I would experience if I just rode it out. They started me on narcotics and muscle relaxants. By this point, my entire body was experiencing random spasms. The worst was in the abdomen. It would spasm and lock up for 30 seconds before releasing. This repeated in a bell curve for better part of 6 hours. 30 seconds of cramping followed by two minutes of relaxation at the beginning and the end while the peak in the middle was 30 seconds of cramping, 30 seconds relaxation.. By morning I was better with the spasms receding. They discharged me and I was fine (albeit) tired.  Embed Quote"

Given the number of black widows that I see around my own house, I'm surprised that we don't see black widow bites on a weekly basis. Instead, I only have a handful of cases after over 20 years in full time clinical practice. This just tells me that they are very shy and are generally loathe to bite humans. Nevertheless, I've witness some pretty severe symptoms with widespread muscle cramps and nausea. Whether we have access to the anti-venom or not, we treat each symptom on it's own with whatever medications we can that will help. Unfortunately, the anti-venom is not available as easily as rattlesnake antivenin and in many cases, by the time you receive the anti-venom, the patient is frequently over the worst part of the syndrome already. Nevertheless, if you are bit by any spider or insect, I recommend catching it (ideally without squishing it) and bringing it in with you so that a positive ID can be made. I DO NOT recommend trying to catch any venomous snake for the same purpose as I have seen a number of people come in to the ED after having been bit on the hand by a snake that they thought was dead.

Of course pets plan their mis-adventures for the worst times.  A Saturday evening.  I had visions of taking the dog to an emergency vet hospital.  The kind where they make you slide hundred dollar bills in a mail slot in the door before unlocking.  Fortunately I had the phone number of just such an after hours vet.  When I explained the dog's symptoms, and told him that I had seen many black widows near the foundation of the house, we both concurred that he had probably been investigating something near the house and stuck his nose into a web.  Upon inspection I found what looked like a bite on his nose.The vet asked if we had any anti-histamine meds, which we did.  Then he asked for Max's weight.  Since Max weighed 140 pounds, the vet recommended doubling the human dosage.  Max took pills beautifully.  All I had to do was pretend they were dog treats and he would gulp them down without a hesitation.I stayed up with him that night and by about 3 am, he was breathing normally.  By noon the next day he still had some swelling and his eyes were puffy, but he was OK.From then on, about once a week I took my bottle gas propane torch and a flashlight out spider hunting around dusk.  Black Widows like to be close to the ground, and they hunt at dusk.  They build webs from the ground up about a foot onto the house foundations.  We never had them inside the house, but I used to smoke a half dozen in an evening with my torch.  Max lived another decade, and achieved the status of best dog I ever had.  Embed Quote"

Beautiful insects, David Quammen has a great essay on them.Not as bad being bitten by thousands of fleas in Hupa. Under a house of a Quebecer, my white tee shirt became black within minutes. Then, biting. I collapsed and my temp rose, I drove back to Eureka to the er, vision doubled and sick as a dog.

Specifically, look for the reported LD50 or LC50 values (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Med...), which is the amount of the chemical required to kill half of the given population of organism (typically rats). You can somewhat extrapolate the LD value to the body mass of a human.

After investigation, he was found to be drinking the hand sanitiser which was available in great quantities. EDIT:-the patients who tend to consume this in hospitals are usually substance dependent alcohol users and they are usually likely to drink large quantities.The products usually contain high percentages of ethanol and isopropanol. The toxic effects are reported by the poisons information centre as follows:-EthanolSevere and potentially fatal2000-4000 mg/L (200-400 mg/dL, 43.4 - 86.9 mmol/L) - Respiratory depression, hypotension, loss of protective airway reflexes (risk of aspiration), hypothermia, incontinence, coma, hypoglycaemia (particularly in children) which can lead to seizures. Polycythemia has been reported.Cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular block have been recorded. Myocardial infarction has been reported after a large acute ingestion (Gowda RM et al, 2003).Metabolic acidosis may be present and may be severe. The degree of acidosis cannot, however, be predicted by blood ethanol concentrations (Zehtabachi et al, 2005). A ketoacidosis may be present particularly following an ethanol binge in patients with a history of chronic ethanol abuse and malnutrition (Peces R, 2008).Isopropanol :-Gastrointestinal: Burning sensation in mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, dysarthria, acetone on the breath, abdominal pain, gastritis, haematemesis, melaena.CNS: Ataxia, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, stupor, hallucinations, areflexia, muscle weakness. In severe poisoning CNS and respiratory depression may occur leading to deep coma, cyanosis, convulsions.Cardiovascular: Initially tachycardia. In severe cases myocardial depression may develop leading to bradycardia, hypotension and dysrhythmias.Other complications may include hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia, red blood cell haemolysis, ketonuria, renal tubular acidosis, hepatic dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, and bronchopneumonia.Obviously these effects are usually only seen in patients who have consumed large quantities so all but the most determined would not have them.  Embed Quote"

A 1-ounce ingestion of a hand sanitizer containing 62% ethanol by a 20-kg child may result in a blood ethanol concentration of >100 mg/dL (4). Typical alcohol related intoxication can be lethal in the range of >=400 mg/dL, although death has occurred at lower levels (2). Acute ethanol intoxication can lead to several serious life-threatening clinical consequences includinig hypothermia, central nervous system and respiratory depression, cardiac dysrhythmias or arrest, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, acute liver injury, myoglobinuria, lactic and ketoacidosis, and hypoglycemia(3). The primary therapy for severe ethanol overdose is primarily provided with airway protection, respiratory support, and addressing associated metabolic disturbances. Hemodialysis is effective at removing ethanol but is usually unnecessary if the airway is protected, there is no other severe organ injury present, and the patient is responding to supportive measures for cardiovascular and metabolic systems. Alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition with fomepizole is contraindicated in hand sanitizer ingestions, because toxicity from ethanol or propanols will be prolonged without added benefit (4). Ref 1.     Am J Health-Syst Pharm—Vol 65 Dec 1, 20082.     Crit Care Resusc 2003; 5:106–1083.     Eur J Intern Med 2008; 19:561–5674.     Critical care medicine 2012; 40 (1):290 -294  Embed Quote"

Per the NYTimes story:Poison Feared in Letters Sent to Obama and LawmakersThe Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Wednesday that a letter addressed to President Obama appeared to contain the poison ricin.The letter was intercepted at a screening facility outside the White House, the Secret Service said.It was received on Tuesday — similar timing to a letter addressed to Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, that tested positive for ricin. The letter addressed to the president had similar markings and was similar in appearance to the one addressed to Mr. Wicker, according to a law enforcement official.In a statement, the F.B.I. said that the letter to the president contained “a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin.” The bureau also said that ricin had been discovered at another mail screening facility.I've seen a few news stories mention that ricin was featured on Breaking Bad, but nobody has speculated about a direct connection yet (i.e., the possibility that whoever sent the poison learned about it from Breaking Bad).It seems likely that Breaking Bad has created more awareness about ricin than any other media format, event, etc.  Embed Quote"

Breaking Bad simply capitalized upon the fearsome nature of the poison and its rarity (along with demonstrating Walter White's chemical abilities) to enhance its narrative. Frankly, ricin is an exceptionally difficult poison to use. Since even minute quantities can injure or kill people, it is hard to employ and its symptoms and the speed of its efficacy would lead medical examiners to search for a toxin as a reason that a person abruptly died or was sickened. I would suggest that the questioner study the case of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident living in London, whose death was caused by ricin. A report of his death and its suspected was one of the most popular segments in the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes and it was aired several times by the network. This case was almost certainly the inspiration for the storyline in Breaking Bad. Reference:Markov's umbrella assassin revealed  Embed Quote"

This includes the ability to consume with enjoyment a host of substances which are poison to our pets. We have a GI tract and biochemistry which has adapted to be able to extract nutrition from marginal foods, to shrug off many toxins, and a sense of taste which informs us in detail about what we are eating. Lets face it, a dog can eat poo and like it - and will happily chomp down on any number of substances which can't even vaguely be considered safe to eat. We've got them outclassed in terms of an anatomy designed to survive on just about anything. Our GI tract is proportionally much longer (and cats, obligate predators, shorter) than dogs, and the microbial flora more extensive. Our jaws can grind from side to side. Our saliva contains digestive enzymes. We're like Alien as far as dogs are concerned holy crap.Our stomachs are relatively small and pass food off to our intestines after a few hours. A Dog's stomach is folded like an accordion to expand to hold a mass of food which is digested over a period of about 24 hours. Our intestines excel at absorbing nutrients and water. A dog with diarrhea can die very quickly compared to a human, as they are unable to compensate for the loss of water and electrolytes. In short, compared to dogs we are amazing eating machines. Of course, we have to admire their enthusiasm for food, themselves. Dogs and Humans, foodie friends.  Embed Quote"

Onions and garlic have the same compounds, so that's not two different toxic substances, it's two delivery systems for the same things.  Dogs won't eat onions in the wild, I'll bet.So I suppose some of the problem is that domestic dogs have access to foods they'd never attend to in the wild.  Grapes don't grow where dogs can get to them, outside of cultivation.Might also be an element of all the filler we put into commercial dog food, teaching dogs to eat stuff they might otherwise reject in the wild.  Embed QuoteAnswered in twenty-eight minutes."

You can see how polluted the shore line is. As to oceans themselves, it is up for debate as to how much pollution actually reaches it, how much is decomposed naturally and how much settles down on the seabed. An indicator would be amount of pollutants found in seafood. The levels of cadmium, aluminum, chromium, lead, silver, mercury, and titanium in fish and mammals has consistently increased over the years.This article refers to the intake of heavy metals by people from approx  1800-1990:http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/co...Another indicator would be the levels of heavy metals found in whales. The reason is that whales travel 50K+ miles, from the poles to the tropics and are mammals themselves. There is overwhelming evidence that the amount of toxic metals in whale tissue has increased too:http://articles.boston.com/2010-...I could go on about these statistics, but we know less about our ocean beds than we do about the lunar surface. Given that seafood is the main source of protein for at least 700 million people, this is a very serious issue that does not get as much attention as say, deforestation or global warming.  Embed Quote"

You would have to decide what mesh-sized net you wanted to use, but you would be inadvertently catching sea life of the same size range, something I assume one would want to avoid.The only solution is to reduce the amount of plastic pollution entering the oceans.

Survival Techniques.,"If you are in a north American desert, the groundwater and wellwater may be full of borax and salt. You will need to distill it, by putting it in a solar still or putting clean hot stones into the water container and covering it with a plastic sheet or glass pane, and letting the purified water drip into a bowl or cup hung in the center of the container. The distilled water is safe to drink and use in the garden. Barrel cactus can be eaten in emergency, but it will give you diarrhea if you gorge on it. Prickly pear leaves can be cooked and eaten if one is careful to cut away all the spines. Prickly pear fruit is very sweet and can also be eaten if spines are removed carefully and completely.If you are in a place that is contaminated due to flooding, filter the available water by straining it through 4 layers of clean cloth and then boiling it for 5 minutes.This will kill the microbes, but not gasoline/petroleum and chemicalcontaminants, you will need to distill the water to get rid of those. If water smells like sewage or sulfur, it may be contaminated by a leaking septic line.You can distill it, but even handling is somewhat unwise, and another water source should be found if possible.  Embed Quote"

Agricultural fertilizers run off into coastal areas (say where the Mississippi empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The excessive plant nutrients causes excessive algae to grow. Algae can use up oxygen at night, die and decompose which uses oxygen, and even block sunlight from plants, depleting oxygen. This results in an area with little oxygen, and so little life. Decaying organic matter like sewage or manure (which also contain these nutrients) can also consume oxygen due to aerobic bacteria.  Embed Quote"

Moreover, there are many historical examples of companies that have done significant damage to communities - whether environmental, financial, or otherwise.  Bankruptcy is designed to allow a breathing spell and to get representatives of all of the stakeholders (meaning the various groups of people who are impacted by the company's operations) to have a say in how the company's assets and liabilities are addressed.  This organized process governed by a set of rules and customs developed over decades offers a far superior alternative to the options which would exist outside of bankruptcy.  Embed Quote"

How bad is it really?,"""How bad is pollution in China"" is a rather broad question. It really depends on what you're asking. It is in China that I've seen some of the clearest, starriest nights I have ever seen in my life. It is also in China that I've seen some of the thickest smog. It is in China that I've seen some of the clearest, most translucent rivers, as well as some of the most polluted.Pollution takes on many forms, and China is a very vast country.If you're talking about CO2, the invisible gas that's going to cause global warming and a type of pollution, USA's per-capita CO2 emissions is about 3 times that of China. Yes, China is the number 1 carbon emitter in the world, but the USA isn't far behind, and China's population is much larger. You don't notice it in either country because, well, CO2 is invisible and quickly goes up there and does some damage to the entire Earth. The CO2 is not going to cause health problems in either case, but will quickly destroy the Earth by warming it up if continued. On the upside, China is making much faster progress on implementing alternative energy solutions and has comparatively excellent public transportation and ability to quickly alter infrastructure, so my prediction is that China's per-capita CO2 emissions will rise a bit but still eventually stabilise at a level much less than that of the USA.If you're talking about dust and smog, China's dense cities tend to be quite bad and I'm sure you've seen the pictures. Beijing has frightening levels of dust and smog right now, though I've seen worse in other countries before. This is a big issue for human health since so many people live in those cities. As for China's natural and less-populated areas, especially Gansu, Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai and most of northern and western Sichuan, the air is generally crystal clear and pristine. So one needs to be more specific about location to analyse this question.If you're talking about chemical pollution into rivers, it highly varies. There's a lot of it downstream and very little of it upstream.In short certain types of pollution are a significant problem in parts of China, but the question is a bit too broad to answer meaningfully beyond that.  Embed Quote"

Using reciprocating plunger pumps, the sludge is then sucked out. Here is what a multi piston reciprocating plunger looks like:The recovered sludge is then put into one or more of these things, called anaerobic biodigesters. Apart from processing the sludge, it generates a good amount of biogas that can easily meet a part of the energy requirements of the processing facility.The final sludge that comes out is nearly as black as oil muck, and has to be put out in sludge drying beds like these. Once it is dry, it becomes organic manure par excellence for any horticultural use, and could presumably used to make the same terrain in and around the canal lush green.But all this stuff needs land to build upon, something which is very scarce in and around the New York area. Besides, the problem in Gowanus now is more that of a CSO (Combined Sewer Overflow) during the rains rather than a direct continuous raw sewage stream. And so, I propose the other solution. It is very cost effective and has negligible initial cost as well as operating cost: Hydroponic floats of the vetiver grass strain that goes by the botanical name Chrysopogon Zizanioides.This so called wonder grass is originally native to southern India but is now known the world over. It has certain very exceptional properties:1) Exceptionally long root system. Five meter roots have been recorded.2) Non self propagating and so non invasive. Produces sterile seeds.3) Has exceptional slope and soil stabilizing as well as binding properties4) Grows fast, needs no special care and is immune even to surface fires5)Takes up high amounts of P and N nutrients as well as some heavy metalsThis is how C. Zizanioides roots look when they are fully grown:These hydroponic vetiver floats are being used in Australia (and Indonesia)And a close up view of a hydroponic float:Yeah, they will just float on the water and pull up all the organic nutrients and heavy metals, leaving just clear water behind. And they look good on the landscape too. Once they have done their job, they just need to be replaced with new young plants.This video suggests how it is done:And this video demonstrates the other property of vetiver: erosion control and soil stabilization. If necessary, this property too can be used to fix the slope along the canal banks. Or they can be planted all around the secure landfills that are used to bury the dried oil muck. C. Zizanioides has excellent ability to prevent landfills from leaching out and contaminating the surrounding areas during rains.I have not included an option that already exists in the Gowanus system but seems to be presently broken: the option of dilution / free flushing of the canal. If one flushes regular seawater down the channel, the muck goes out to the open sea. Although the sea is a so called ""infinite sink"" in theory, in practice this stuff will not disperse evenly across the entire body. It will dilute but still be a problem for local aquatic life. What it does is that it washes the Augean Stables, Hercules fashion. It does not attack the problem at its root.Time scale? Given the size and severity of the problem, a decade seems reasonable. Expense? If one builds future inflation and cost escalation, some USD 350 million to 450 million is the estimated range.  Embed QuoteVia  Betsy Megas."

All the water on Earth must have passed through the bladders of various beasties many times over the millions of years. Think about it: The oceans are full of fish piss. Is that pollution? Why does it not bother us? Well, water evaporates, forms clouds, falls as rain. We drink mainly rainwater, and water from rain. Another factor: This morning we were out walking in the local wildlife sanctuary. The water there is treated sewage plant effluent. There are big signs saying ""Don't touch the water. It's sewage effluent."" Yet the water is full of waterbirds and fish and otters and frogs and many other things. It's not hurting them. I've watched my dog drink from muddy puddles in the road with no ill effect. Are we really that much weaker than these creatures? Or is the notion of pollution a bit overblown? Maybe we need a bit of pollution to strengthen our immune systems for maximum health and resistance. Evaporation, clouds, rain. That is the absolute best water treatment technology.  Embed Quote"

Maybe some of these are accurate.  But, cleaning up really polluted sites presents huge engineering challenges and, by nature, is going to take time -- maybe more time than it took to pollute the sites in the first place.  And cleaning a really polluted site to greenfield standards just doesn't make economic sense.  Embed Quote"

Nothing could                  be further from the truth.                       The freedom of people to choose natural healing,  alternative medicine                 and methods of disease prevention  could soon be threatened by corporate                 lobbyists who will  do anything to protect their wealth at the expense                 of  your health.                    Promoters of                 conventional  medicine claim that all the drug studies, approvals,                  surgical procedures,  all other treatments are based                 on  scientific evidence.  But is it really science? What passes for  ""science""                 today is a collection of health myths,  half-truths, intellectual                 dishonesty and  fraudulent  reporting to help serve higher interests. Science is not really science anymore.                    90 percent of                 all diseases  (cancer, diabetes, depression, heart disease, etc.)                 are  easily preventable through diet, nutrition, sunlight and exercise.                  None of these solutions are ever promoted by conventional  medicine                 because they make no money.                    No pharmaceuticals                 actually cure  or resolve the underlying causes of disease. Even                  ""successful"" drugs only manage symptoms, usually at the                  cost of interfering with other physiological functions that will                  cause side effects down the road. There is no such thing as a  drug                 without a side effect.                    There is no                 financial incentive  for anyone in today's system of medicine (drug                  companies, hospitals, doctors, etc.) to actually make patients well.                  Profits are found in continued sickness, not wellness or  prevention.                    Almost all                 the ""prevention""  programs you see today (such as free                 mammograms or other  screening programs) are nothing more than  patient recruitment schemes  designed to increase revenue and sickness. They use free screenings                  to scare people into agreeing to unnecessary treatments that  only lead to further disease. Mammography is a very good example. Chemotherapy is another. Nobody has any                 interest in your health except you. No  corporation, no doctor, and                 no government has any desire  to actually make you well. This has                 served the  short-term financial interests of higher powers in the                  west very well. The only healthy, aware, critically thinking individuals                  are all 100% free of pharmaceuticals and processed  foods.YTH #2 Vaccines prevent diseases and increase immunity.                                                                  The term                     ""immunization"",  often substituted for vaccination,                     is false and  should be legally challenged. Medical research                     has  well established that the direct injection of foreign proteins                      and other toxic material (particularly known  immune-sensitising                     poisons such as mercury) makes  the recipient more, not less,                     easily affected by  what he/she encounters in the future. This                     means  they do the opposite of immunize, commonly even preventing                      immunity from developing after natural exposure.                         The actual                     frequency of  health problems has been estimated by authorities                     to  be possibly up to 100 times, or more, greater than that reported                      by government agencies. That difference is due to the lack  of                     enforcement or incentive for doctors to report  adverse effects.                     With the anti-vaccination movements  now exposing the truth on                     the internet, the medical  community is now on high alert, defending                     their  claims and being told by vaccine manufacturers that they                      must never let their patients (or parents) think that the risks                      could outweigh the benefits, when in reality, it is  precisely                     the opposite that is true.                          The benefit risk ratio is an important  decision in anyone deciding                   whether to vaccinate or  not. Contrary to popular belief and marketing,                    childhood diseases in a developed country are not as dangerous                    as we are led to believe. Catching a particular disease does  not                   mean you willdie from it. Vaccines were actually introduced at a time when                    diseases had already declined to a low risk level. This fact is                    proven, scientifically.                          The main advances in combating   disease over  the last 200 years have been better   food and clean drinking  water...not vaccines. Improved sanitation, less overcrowded   and better  living conditions also   contribute. This is also borne out   in  published peer reviewed research which prove that vaccine did not save us.All vaccines contain sterility agents, neurotoxins, immunotoxins, and carcinogenic compounds. Some examples include formaldehyde, a carcinogen found in almost every vaccine,  neurotoxins such as monosodium glutamate, potassium                 chloride, thimerosal, sterility agents such as Triton X-100, octoxynol-10, polysorbate 80, and immuntoxins such as neomycin, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium deoxycholate to name a few of many. It is no coincidence that the more educated you are, the less chance you will vaccinate which contradicts the misconceptions of many health  professionals who      profess that parents don't vaccinate because they are  under-educated,     poor or misinformed. Those who become fully informed  of the dangers of   vaccines never see them in the same light again, as  their motives then   become clear.                           MYTH #3 We must all focus on lowering bad cholesterol.                          Perhaps one                 of the biggest  health myths propagated in western culture and certainly                  in the United States, is the misuse of an invented term ""bad                 cholesterol""  by the media and medical community. Moreover,                 a  scientifically-naive public has been conned into a fraudulent                  correlation between elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular  disease                 (CVD). Cholesterol has not been shown to  actually cause CVD. To                 the contrary, cholesterol is  vital to our survival, and trying to                 artificially lower  it can have detrimental effects, particularly                 as we age.We have become a culture so obsessed with eating foods                        low in cholesterol and fat that many health experts are now    questioning the consequences. Could we really maintain a dietary     lifestyle that was so  foreign to many of our ancestral populations    without any ill effects on our health? Many researchers are now    concluding that the answer to that question is ""NO."" Current data is now    suggesting that lower cholesterol levels predate the development of    cancer.The 'noddy-science' offered by marketing men to a generally                        scientifically-naive public has led many people to    believe that                     we should replace certain food choices    with specially developed                     products that can help    'reduce cholesterol'. Naturally this                     comes at a    price and requires those who can afford it to pay                        maybe four or five times what a 'typical ordinary' product might                        cost. But is this apparent 'blanket need' to strive  towards                       lowering our cholesterol justified? And,  indeed, is   it healthy?The cholesterol itself, whether being transported                     by    LDL or HDL,                     is exactly the same. Cholesterol is    simply a necessary ingredient                     that is required to  be   regularly delivered around the body for                     the    efficient healthy development, maintenance and functioning                        of our cells. The difference is in the 'transporters' (the    lipoproteins                     HDL and LDL) and both types are    essential for the human body's                     delivery logistics to    work effectively. Problems can occur, however, when the LDL particles are both                        small and their carrying capacity outweighs the  transportation                       potential of available HDL. This  can lead to more   cholesterol                     being 'delivered'  around the body with   lower resources for returning                      excess capacity to the   liver. MYTH #4 Medical screening and treatments prevent death.                          Even though the medical community advocates  for regular screenings                     for those with illnesses,  they may bring little benefit and                     may actually pose  harm to your health. This applies to almost                     every  type of medical screening for cancer and several other                      diseases. Medical screening carries an immense risk in itself,                      not only due to the damage inflicted by screening  techniques                     on the human body, but by the very nature  of medical follow-up                     protocols. These protocols  usually encourage patients to enter                     deeper into more  invasive techniques, which further cripple                     health  and lead to a very high percentage of fatalities.                          In a Swedish study of 60,000   women, 70  percent of    the mammographically detected tumors weren't   tumors at  all. These ""false    positives"" aren't just financial and   emotional  strains, they may also    lead to many unnecessary and   invasive  biopsies. In fact, 70 to 80 percent    of all positive   mammograms do not, upon biopsy, show any presence of cancer.                          A prostate (PSA) blood test looks for  prostate-specific                    antigen, a protein produced by the  prostate gland. High levels                    are supposedly associated  with prostate cancer. The problem                    is that the  association isn't always correct, and when it is,                    the  prostate cancer isn't necessarily deadly. Only about 3 percent of all  men die from prostate cancer. The                    PSA test usually  leads to overdiagnosis -- biopsies and treatment                    in  which the side effects are impotence and incontinence. Repeated biopsies   may spread cancer cells                    into the track formed by  the needle, or by spilling cancerous                    cells directly  into the bloodstream or lympathic system.News coverage                     of many  diseases focus too much on treatments and not enough                      on prevention, a trend that could prove risky in the long run                      for most people who don't understand how to take care of  their                     health.                           The biggest single type of story we usually  hear about on the                     news involves treatment, and  narratives lend themselves much                     better to that kind  of story. Stories about prevention, about                     people  exercising and eating right, just don’t make great                     copy.                         If our current                     treatment  approach to health continues, hundreds of years from                      now, mankind may look back at today’s “modern medicine”                      and think: “How could they have been so primitive in ideology                      and so wrong? What lack of humanitarianism in government  allowed                     the medical industries to kill people with  economically driven                     false beliefs and ideas? Why  didn’t government stop them?                     Who were the people in  charge of protecting those citizens?                                                    Preventive                     education  demands increased funding for research into new dietary,                      physical activity, behavioural, socioeconomic, environmental                      and medical approaches for the prevention of chronic  disease.                     Children who grow into teenagers and then  adults require more                     accountability for their own  well-being through health conscious                     decisions which  are motivated by proper practical and theoretical                      applications. They need to know that treatment modalities and                      pharmaceutical applications may not save their health in the                      future. Substantial political and financial  contributions are                     also imperative to invest in  prevention more effectively to                     regulate revisions  and mandate policies which affect the governing                      bodies of health and education. Any procrastination or failure                      to resolve these matters in the next decade will only lead to                      the further deterioration of human health and  healthcare systems.                     Proper leadership and effective  communication regarding these                     preventive measures  may still reverse screening/treatment trends                     and  consequently reverse this thinking to ultimately promote                      a healthier aging population.MYTH #5 Fluoride prevents tooth decay.Water fluoridation is a hoax.  Drinking any                 amount of fluoride is dangerous to your  health and has NEVER been                 proven to prevent tooth decay.  It's actually the biggest scientific                 fraud ever to be  promoted by national and international Governments.                  Fluoride has been linked to osteoporosis, cancer, auto-immune diseases,                  and even very small concentrations can disrupt DNA  repair enzymes                 by 50%.  The fluoride added to our water is a waste product of   aluminum and    phosphate fertilizer processing. And it’s not even calcium   fluoride    that appears naturally in water, but sodium fluoride, which is a    whole   different thing--and loaded with bad news.  In fact, sodium fluoride has no good news. Except for a few suspect      reports by the people selling the stuff, study after research study      proves that sodium fluoride does not protect our teeth, and it does a      number on our bones. And on other body parts, too, including our  thyroid     gland.  - Fluoride was found to be an equivocal carcinogen by the                                                    National Cancer Institute  Toxicological Program.   - Drinking fluoridated water will double the number of hip                         fractures for both older men and women.     -  Infertility in women was found to increase with water                          fluoridation.                       Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) scientists reported                         a close  correlation between decreasing total fertility rates                          in women between ages of 10 and 49, and increasing fluoride                          levels.                           - Fluoride has never been found to   effectively reducing tooth decay by any notable margin.                         No causation or even correlation was found between the level of  fluoride                         in water and dental caries in any  study.  Fluoride also attacks the pineal  gland. The pineal controls our  inner     clock, provides good sleep, works with our adrenal glands to  handle     stress, keeps the thymus gland fed and cared for, and  communicates 24/7     with the rest of the endocrine system about how  things are going.     Fluoride calcifies our pineal gland into a  non-functioning rock.                          -                          The government classifies sodium fluoride as  environmentally     hazardous waste. Anybody handling it must wear  HazMat protective gear.     Dumping it into rivers is a crime.                          Much of                     the original  proof that fluoride is safe for   humans in low doses                      was generated by A-bomb program   scientists, who had been secretly                      ordered to   provide ""evidence useful in litigation""                      against   defense contractors for fluoride injury to  citizens.                       The first lawsuits against the U.S.  A-bomb program were not                       over radiation, but over  fluoride damage, the documents show.                          It seems that the healthiest  people on the planet right now are those that have deviated from the  norms of conventional medical quackery, and have migrated towards  natural health. The proof is in the pudding. Find the healthiest 5  people you know and you'll find they typically don't subscribe to the  health myths promoted by mainstream medicine. Your longevity and aging  gracefully depends on it.                                          Marco Torres is a research specialist, writer and     consumer advocate                                  for healthy lifestyles. He holds     degrees in  Public         Health     and                     Environmental Science  and       is a         professional     speaker on topics                    such   as   disease           prevention,     environmental toxins  and health     policy.Okay I am skeptik about the first two, but the last one is really bothering me the most...The water full of carcinogen..? Could it be true?","Virtually all information presented by these people is false or deliberately misleading. They are charlatans. They employ scare tactics to drive up their page views, then sell advertising space to the true snake oil salesmen. Sorry, but if it's from a site that posts these conspiracy theories it's wrong or it's information perverted to sound convincing. They are scum.1. This is where alarm bells ring. ""Mainstream medicine"" he says, like there are valid alternatives. Then of course he sets the scene, this one is not about being truthful, it's about setting up the pitch. He needs to convince you the legion of people who are going to school, working 18 hour days and breaking their backs to give care to the ill are EVIL, because if they weren't pure satan excrement how could you believe they are part of a vast conspiracy to make (and keep) people sick. He also attacks science, because when he makes later arguments, science will not help his cause. Like I said, this is just groundwork though and is meant to reach out to those who follow alternative medicine. You can tell from his mentioning of them as realistic option, and his mention of ""the vast corporate hegemony"" attacking it.He mentions how exercise, diet and sunlight are the three things you need to be healthy. But he implies that doctors don't tell people these things, like it's some kind of huge secret the way most of us live is unhealthy.Of course he finishes with ""the only healthy people are the ones who don't take medicine"" which makes me think he's not all that good at this. Or thinking in general.2. Vaccines! I just have no words for this one. Is taking yearly flu vaccinations over the top? Shit, probably, just get the flu and run the chance of death you pussy. Vaccines for kids? In my day kids dropped like flies and you know what? We liked it that way! Helped the cream rise to the top!Seriously though this is mostly propaganda. He makes an appeal to intelligence (smart people don't vaccinate). He fully embraces the science he rejected earlier because it proves his point and he uses the anti-vaccination network as proof there is something wrong with vaccinations. That's like saying since the KluKluxKlan exists, black people are subhuman.3. Fuck you Mr Writer AND fuck the doctors. I'll eat what I like and get a bypass. (At least I am honest.)4. Medical testing doesn't save lives???   Maybe he's right, I assume cancer just goes away if you don't check for it.Like pulses in babies. I did get a little hot under the collar when he talked about the results of prostate cancer and tried to say the ""negative side effects"" were worth leaving the cancer untreated. ""Don't check for cancer, it might spread the cancer through your system"" he said that. He fucking said it. Not me. Him.5. Helps teeth, only causes the symptoms he mentioned at ludicrously higher doses than we receive. Based off tests on children in India exposed to huge chemical contamination. Since he's using the suffering of children to sell bottled water, is he evil?Yes. Yes he is.  Embed Quote"

Secondly, 'According to a research'.With any kind of claim like this, the best thing to do before reposting it is to quickly Google the argument outlined. I just searched for 'benzene poisoning air conditioning' and the first result was from Snopes. [1] This immediately suggests that the claim presented in the image is not entirely true, as Snopes is a site that examines commonly-held myths and urban legends.The article quotes almost exactly the text of the image included in the question context. It lists the date of this as May 2009. The article begins by listing actual research by the American Cancer Society about the dangers of Benzene and its links to cancer. The Snopes article then provides an extract from a scientific study carried out by a South Korean university [2] that seems to refute some of the claims made in the image.A short summary of the study's findings is that it is not the dashboard of the car that emits the highest level of Benzene, but actually the fuel. In addition to this, they found that Benzene levels were higher in older cars, refuting the claim that the 'new car smell' is partly to blame. Finally, they found Benzene levels to be higher during winter, casting doubt on the claim that air conditioning elevates the level.

The amounts of synthetic pesticide residues in plant foods, for example, are extremely low compared to the amounts of natural “pesticides” produced by plants themselves (Ames et al., 1990a; Ames et al., 1990b; Gold et al., 1999; Gold et al., 1997b; Gold and Zeiger, 1997). Of all dietary pesticides that humans eat, 99.99% are natural: these are chemicals produced by plants to defend themselves against fungi, insects, and other animal predators (Ames et al., 1990a; Ames et al., 1990b). Each plant produces a different array of such chemicals. On average, the Western diet includes roughly 5,000 to 10,000 different natural pesticides and their breakdown products. Americans eat about 1,500 mg of natural pesticides per person per day, which is about 10,000 times more than they consume of synthetic pesticide residues (Ames et al., 1990b). Even though only a small proportion of natural pesticides has been tested for carcinogenicity, half of those tested (38/72) are rodent carcinogens; naturally occurring pesticides that are rodent carcinogens are ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices (Gold et al., 1997b; Gold et al., 1992) (Table 2).Cooking of foods produces burnt material (about 2,000 mg per person per day) that contains many rodent carcinogens. In contrast, the residues of 200 synthetic chemicals measured by United States Federal Drug Administration, including the synthetic pesticides thought to be of greatest importance, average only about 0.09 mg per person per day (Ames et al., 1990a; Gold et al., 1997b; Gold et al., 1992). In a single cup of coffee, the natural chemicals that are rodent carcinogens are about equal in weight to an entire year’s worth of synthetic pesticide residues that are rodent carcinogens, even though only 3% of the natural chemicals in roasted coffee have been adequately tested for carcinogenicity (Gold et al., 1992) (Table 3). This does not mean that coffee or natural pesticides are a cancer risk for humans, but rather that assumptions about high-dose animal cancer tests for assessing human risk at low doses need reexamination. No diet can be free of natural chemicals that are rodent carcinogens (Gold et al., 1999; Gold et al., 1997b; Gold and Zeiger, 1997)  Embed QuoteAnswered in thirty-one minutes via  Anonymous."

And there's more - tissue cloning and regeneration technologies, again closely linked with cancer research might one day unlock some pretty sweet biotech... Lets all have steak without hurting cows. How about choosing what age you want to remain for the rest of your practically immortal lifespan? Regrowing damaged limbs and organs? Reviving species we have driven to extinction? Sure what I'm talking about is science fiction - so was Jules Verne's electrically powered underwater submersible in that rather lengthy novel he wrote back when. And sure there are potential horrors as well as the benefits. That's the funny thing about increasing knowledge, it unlocks doors that we as societies must choose to open or not.

Each cancer's evolution is as unique as the individual who is unfortunate enough to possess the uncontrolled growth. Factors like genetics, tobacco, alcohol, physical inactivity, obesity, and randomness, are important factors in human cancers. Mutations in a wide variety of either cell replication and suppressor genes (and their associated proteins) have also been correlated with a wide variety of cancers. In terms of treatments, the basic 3 (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy) still remain, but significant refinements have been made over the last 50 years, especially in the areas of targeted chemicals, which can mitigate a wide variety of malicious gene expressions, and minimize collateral damage. One striking observations is while many animals are susceptible to cancer, mole rats are not.

In many ways the increase in cancer can be explained by better detection of cause of death and an increase in overall life expectancy.  We could eradicate all environmental and behavior causes and still not eradicate cancer because spontaneous genetic mutations will still occur.  If we want to extend the average human life span we need to understand and address the fundamental causes of cancer and find methods for ensuring the fidelity of genetic replication.  Embed Quote"

Eventually one cell will figure out a way to get outside the box your body wants it in.The things we think ""cause"" cancer work in two ways. Either they damage the body's built in error checking and repair systems, or they increase the rate of mutations and entropy in the system.  Embed Quote"

You think we can solve the problem by identifying and  exterminating the guilty party. That's not how science works.The term risk factor means there is a statistical correlation between the variables you mentioned and cancer, not necessarily that they cause it. There may be a third variable, called a confounder, that causes both. Correlation does not show causation. To validly say A causes B, we need to know the the sequence of events (etiology) that lead from A to B. Then we will know enough to do something about it.Applying statistics about groups to individuals is called an ecological fallacy. The Wikipedia article has an excellent mathematical proof. It was illustrated by a 1950 paper by William S. Robinson in which he pointed out there is positive correlation between state literacy and immigrant population percent by state. A naive interpretation would be that immigrants are more literate than natives, yet tests on immigrants showed they have below average literacy. The explanation is immigrants are not randomly distributed. They prefer urban states, which have above average literacy. They lower, not raise, the literacy of their adopted states. A naive interpretation of the correlation led to a conclusion that was 180 degrees incorrect.  Embed Quote"

One of my professors worked in the soap industry and we had lengthy conversations about chemicals found in soaps, shampoos, and detergents.  SLS and SLES are benign lathering agents with no documented general risks or adverse effects.  Both have been studied rigorously by independent agencies.  Because of the “electric” pull and the size of the molecule, it does not enter the skin and end up “in your system.”  This is true for most other ingredients in shampoo as well. SLS and SLES don’t grow on trees but they are derived from nature.  Because the process of doing so occurs in a lab, they are known as chemicals.  However, there is a difference between chemicals derived from nature and those constructed by man.  Any ingredient with a number in the name is synthetic (manmade) and in large quantities can become a health hazard.  1,4 Dioxane (synthetic chemical carcinogen) and quaternium-15 (a formaldehyde releasing preservative) are ones to watch for. In addition to synthetic chemicals (again, usually has a number in the name), watch out for “fragrance” on a product’s ingredient list.  Under FDA law, a manufacturer does not have to disclose ingredients labeled as “fragrance” to protect against knockoff perfume formulations.  Ingredients used to scent shampoos, soaps or detergents are not disclosed to any governing agency and that is where known cancer causing agents may be purposefully hidden. There are movements in the US to change the “fragrance” protection law but the US Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA) has strong lobbyists who are paid well by a 60 billion dollar industry.  The EU has banned over 1100 chemicals from personal care products because they may cause cancer, birth defects or reproductive problems.  The US has banned only 9. In the meantime, you can protect yourself by avoiding synthetic chemicals and products that contain “fragrance” on the ingredient list.  Switching brands frequently might also help to reduce continued exposure to the unlisted ingredients.  Alone, the ""natural chemicals” in shampoo, such as SLS and SLES, are not going to harm you but the fragrance might. Check out my blog.  Nurse Gail - Gail Ingram is a NYC nurse sharing her perspective on health care and wellness.  Embed Quote"

You might think this was about dangerous ingredients or some terrible threat to the health of American children.In fact, the suits alleged that manufacturer Ferrero misrepresented the product as ""part of a healthy breakfast"" in its advertising.   Ferrero says you should eat their spread with fruit, milk, and other healthy foods, which seems pretty reasonable.  Ferrero lost (""Only in America""!) and paid out a bunch of Euros.Nutella's main ingredients are plainly marked on the label as required by law:  sugar (a 37 g serving is 22 g of sugar! - that's almost 60%), palm oil (fat, 11 g or 30%), hazelnuts (a bit of fat, and a bit of fibre), cocoa, skim milk, and some bits such as vanillin and lecithin (an emulsifier).  Carcinogenic?  Nah.  Nutritious?  Uh...  If you're curious, 22g of sugar is 3 heaping teaspoons.Nutella claims that a slice of toast with their spread compares nutritionally to a slice of toast with jam, which nobody considers unhealthy.   However, Montreal paper La Presse pointed out that a spoonful of store-bought chocolate icing – which was half the price of Nutella – had fewer calories, half the fat and less sugar than the same quantity of Nutella.  So save money, spread chocolate icing on your breakfast bagel, and munch away.  Embed Quote"

I use all three, but only non-BPA Nalgenes.  Here's the Wiki on BPAs:""BPA is controversial because it exerts weak, but detectable, hormone-like properties, raising concerns about its presence in consumer products and foods contained in such products. Starting in 2008, several governments questioned its safety, prompting some retailers to withdraw polycarbonate products. A 2010 report from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised further concerns regarding exposure to fetuses, infants, and young children.[2] In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance.[3][4] The European Union, Canada, and recently the United States have banned BPA use in baby bottles.[5][6]""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bis...  Let's look at 1) Camelback2) Non-BPA Nalgene3) Stainless steel or glass or ceramic1. Camelback has become my absolute favorite for hiking/backpacking/ any physical activity because it's really nice not to have to root around for your water source while you're moving.  It's light, it's safe (non-BPA) and it's easy to fit in a pack.  Downside: you have to clean it carefully, doing a final rinse with alcohol to sterilize and evaporate any leftover water drops that could mildew in the water line.2. Nalgene bottles (non-BPA) are nice because they are light and easy to clean.  We still use one 1-litre bottle for collection/sterilization with a Steri-Pen for cooking and filling the Camelbacks.  Downside:  water tastes funny after it has been in one, especially after a long time or if the bottle has heated from the sun, etc.This is of special concern to me as the parent of a child (see above).  The jury's still out, I may be wrong, but the early research is concerning enough for me to not take undue chances, especially during my son's main growing years.3. Stainless steel/glass/ceramic is my favorite for everyday desk and daypacks/lunchpacks.  It's heavy, but if you don't have to carry it far it's not an issue.  The water simply tastes the best from these non-leaching containers. Steel is the obvious choice for children's lunchboxes/packs because it's non-breakable and dishwasher-safe for sterilization.  Embed Quote"

(They are designed for hydration systems, but I use them just to hold water.) While hiking, I prefer to drink from a 500 cc Nalgene bottle rather than a hydration system because I want to know the amount I am drinking either to make sure I am fully hydrated or to ration water on a long dry stretch - hydration systems usually don't let you know easily how much you are drinking)   So I usually bring 2-3 Nalgene 500 cc wide-mouth bottles for collecting water, for drinking on trail and for convenience. The wide mouths (esp. on the square bottles) make it easy to pick up water from a lake or a shallow stream (small mouths are a pain unless you always use a filter that fits the small mouth).  In winter or over high passes, the wide mouths also allow you to put in some snow periodically to replenish water you are drinking.  I have one round 500cc Nalgene which has the ounce (and cc) measurements printed up the side, which is useful when doing trail cooking (e.g., measuring 8 oz for  my morning oatmeal and 12 oz for evening soups).  I also typically carry one or two square widemouth 500 cc Nalgenes which are wrapped in black 10-mil plumbers tape and are each fitted with a clip that attaches  easily to a PALS strap on my shoulder harness.   (Picture shows the bottle with clear duct tape securing the clip - I now prefer the black tape both for warming and because it is a bit stronger).  The black tape warms up the water, mostly good in winter to melt added snow but also slightly saving fuel if I use it for cooking (if I want water to stay cool, I can put it inside the pack). If you plan to use this in winter, fashion the clip so the bottle hangs with the threads faced downward (the threads will freeze tight if carried upright). If you can carry water forward of your center of gravity it slightly helps you hiking balance. You didn't ask about this, but I will gratuitously add: (1) a folding bucket is a great addition because you can draw plenty of water quickly and then get away from the water's edge (important in our Sierra Nevada mosquito season); and (2) a 17 ounce Platypus bottle is a great way to carry olive oil to add calories to most any dinner or for field-making hummus or tabbouleh (olive oil otherwise likes to leak). Though once used for olive oil, you won't be using it for water.  Grainger.com has a good selection of wide-mouth Nalgene bottles in a variety of sizes and shapes (and with ounce measurements). Platypus bladders are available at REI. PS: a one-ounce Nalgene gives you a way to measure out the olive oil without getting a measuring cup all oily and nasty. Sorry, way too much information is response to a shorter question.   Embed Quote"

Specifically, look for the reported LD50 or LC50 values (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Med...), which is the amount of the chemical required to kill half of the given population of organism (typically rats). You can somewhat extrapolate the LD value to the body mass of a human.

Smoking foods, as cooking them over a wood or charcoal fire, does produce chemicals that are known to be, in some circumstances, carcinogenic.What is not known, and therefore makes the answer wrong, is the amount of those chemicals that will cause a cancer in humans. There are many chemicals that are, in the lab, demonstrably carcinogenic, but only in enormous doses do they show any affect in living beings. Further, some test animals are not good models for human health because those animals react differently than do humans. Some chemicals known to cause cancer in some animals have simply never been proved to do so in humans.The best, that is, the most accurate thing that can be said is that smoked foods might be a problem, in some circumstances, at some level of ingestion, for some people. A categorical 'yes' or 'no' is not only uncalled for, it is unsupported by research.Unless one is consuming vast quantities of smoked foods, daily, then there's likely little risk from consuming smoked foods, at least according to the latest research.  Embed Quote"

When there is a correlation shown in studies, it's usually negative; that is, coffee is associated with a reduced risk rather than an increased risk of various cancers. Much of the evidence suggests that coffee consumption is neutral at worst and protective at best.For instance, coffee consumption has been shown to be negatively correlated with colon cancer [1, 2] and pancreatic cancer [3] in some studies. With other types of cancer, such bladder cancer, its unclear whether there is a negative correlation or not, and its negative connection to pancreatic cancer is also unclear [4]; however there certainly doesn't seem to be a positive correlation in such studies. Like I said, neutral at worst.There's also a possible protective effect against liver cancer [5].

It is also a good source of protein and many minerals, including calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, manganese and phosphorus. Broccoli is also a good source of dietary fiber. Broccoli contains vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E and vitamin K as well as the B vitamins riboflavin, vitamin B6 and folate. It is also high in selenium, a mineral known to reduce free radicals and support a healthy immune system.Does it lose nutrients when roasting? Of course, but enough nutrients are retained to still make it a powerhouse source of vitamins and minerals. To prevent some nutrient loss storing vegetables in the refrigerator, until ready to cook, should help retain nutrients.  As far as being carcinogenic, when cooked more than a few minutes, broccoli's antioxidants aren't as adept at knocking out carcinogens that cause cancer. http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt.... But as far as them being carcinogenic themselves when browned, they present a far lesser risk than browned/burned meat. http://www.foodrevolution.org/as...In my opinion, keep raw broccoli to snack on, but for dinner, roast it.I toss broccoli stems (halved lengthwise) and florets in a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper, roast them at 425° for about 20 minutes. When they're done and partially browned take them out, and while still red hot, sprinkle with a bit more olive oil, lemon and fresh grated parmigiano.  Embed Quote"

It is not an inexpensive material, and therefore not used in disposable situations.The FDA continues to look at the BPA situation, but just recently as last month, again, decided that the material is not dangerous enough to change any regulations over it.Look at it this way: BPA has been in the food chain and studied for over 50 years, and is still considered ""safe"". Yet some would have us throw it all away for a new (undecided) material that does not have this track record.

How many diabetics lose a foot to gangrene because of a glass shard? Is that really outweighed by those harmed by BPA?I can tell you. In Philadelphia alone, 39 out of 243 children surveyed needed professional medical intervention due to an injury from broken glass. see (Reported incidence of injuries caused by street glass among urban children in Philadelphia)  Both in England and the US, broken bottle glass has been reported to be the leading cause of lacerations, accounting for 15–27% of all lacerations seen in an urban emergency department. (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubm... , and Armstrong AM, Molyneux E. Glass injuries to children. BMJ 1992;304:360). Glass is not a solution- it is a problem.Now, you might argue that littering and pollution are the real dangers. But even from my own personal experience, I've been injured by little shards of glass in my home months later even when I thought I've carefully swept up broken glass. Luckily, even though the infection from one of those times was severe, I didn't need to get antibiotics for it, just a tweezer, some alcohol, a lot of pain and pus, and time. A diabetic neighbor of mine was not so lucky- a stray flake of glass in her home went unnoticed and she lost part of her foot. It doesn't mean I don't have lots of glass around in my home- I know it's a danger. I just don't use it everyday if I can avoid doing so. You are better off with polycarbonate or HDPE plastics, which are almost unbreakable compared to glass. Nalgene brand plasticware has been a virtual de-facto standard in chemistry labs I've worked in due to its safety and lack of contamination of experiments. But don't expect to put them in the microwave, dishwasher, or the oven: all materials have a suitable and appropriate use.see also: Beauty: How dangerous are parabens, sulfates, and phthalates in everyday beauty products?  Embed Quote"

I have two words for you: Herd immunity (I'll explain it further down).Viruses and bacteria are programmed to make more mistakes during their replications, inducing more versatility in their genome, making it harder for our natural immune system to keep up with them. In the past, survivors of mass outbreaks were those people who were lucky enough to have the right predisposition in their immune system to either overcome an infection or be naturally resistant to a strain or virus. All others would be subject to being wiped out. This is nothing more than an act of natural selection. Those better fit to survive will continue existing and procreating, others are removed from existence. As medicine progressed, we began understanding how the immune system recognizes these microscopic invaders, and began formulating essentially a jump-start serum that would create a profile, if you will, of a specific invader in your immune system. This is analogous to a ""Wanted"" sign with the picture of a culprit in Western movies. Your body receives a way to identify the intruders, meaning that if the actual bacteria or virus does come along, your body can recognize it faster and get rid of it. By practicing this in a widespread manner, we develop what we refer to as ""herd immunity"", where we have a large concentrated population of individuals who have gained this advantage over an infectious agent. In order for the agent to replicate, it needs a host. If all the hosts are resistant, the agent will eventually run out of energy, and, without a means to replicate, will be eliminated from existence. This is how smallpox was eradicated (even though strains are still being preserved in the CDC). So here's my point: humans are the most sophisticated species because we can specialize, communicate, and apply innovations broadly across our population. Vaccinations are no different. If you want to continue living as a part of a species that, with its vast potential, can bend the laws of natural selection, go on and take advantage of these services. If you want to be skeptic, no one is going to stop you from taking your chances against the forces of nature. You can find out what natural selection has in store for you.Now for a caveat: herd immunity works wonders when everyone is vaccinated. If there are people among the ""herd"" who refuse vaccinations and become infected, that virus or bacteria has the potential to develop new mutations within your body, and it most likely will. This will result in essentially a new form of the virus, and it is likely that the current vaccine in play will no longer be effective, meaning you would be a walking biological weapon, so to speak: a massive threat to society. You are now a danger to the entire herd. The genius of our species can bend the laws of natural selection. The stupidity of our species can completely undo the work of many brilliant minds. It's so sad to think about.  Embed Quote"

Some of the hypothesized mechanisms for serious side effects are mercury toxicity from the preservative thiomersal (now removed from most vaccines even though no link was established), aluminum from adjuvants, and immune system overload. Most/all of the serious risks have only been established via anecdotes and isolated studies that have not been reproduced despite follow up studies. However, it's true that less serious side-effects (e.g., soreness) are well-known to occur as a result of vaccinations sometimes.It is worth noting that the vaccine controversy is an excellent example of the tragedy of the commons. Much of the benefit from vaccines is from herd immunity. That is, when a child is vaccinated, other children that come into contact with that child are also protected because they can't be infected by the vaccinated child. This is especially helpful because some members of the population, such as the very young and very old, cannot be vaccinated.If one parent decides not to vaccinate their child out of toxicity concerns, this isn't a problem, but if many people make this decision, then many children may fall ill, including those whose parents could not even opt for vaccination if they wanted.  Embed Quote"

When she was 8 weeks old, I had the routine shots done. This was in 2003, and if I am not mistaken there were EIGHT vaccines she was given that day. MeaslesMumpsRubellaDiptheriaTetanusPertussisPolioHepatitis B. She was a healthy child, born at term, healthy weight, no issues, no risk factors that I knew of. I was an excited and happy first time mother and proud of myself for taking good care of her. Right after the appointment, my daughter became fussy and would not be comforted for the next hour or so. This did not phase me, I knew shots made babies fussy. Maybe 2 hours after the appointment, she began to have seizures. The fussiness became full blown non-stop screaming, with her back arched in a horrible way. She was later diagosed with encephalitis, and she was screaming like that because of the pressure of her swollen brain inside her skull. We are very, very lucky that we were able to control her reaction and that she has no long term effects today from that reaction. It was one of the scariest things, as a parent, I have ever gone through! On the advice of our doctor, after this reaction we decided to go to a separated / delayed vaccine schedule to lessen the chance of a second reaction. The next time she had a vaccine (and it was even IPV / polio, one that according to my doctor, ""no one could possibly be allergic to!"") she broke out in so many red welts she looked like a tiny lobster. She had to be hospitalized and given courses of steroids to bring THAT reaction under control. So two strikes, and we were out. A whole team of allergists and our pediatric group conferred on her case, and they told us that even if we wanted to try more vaccines with her, they would not be willing to do it. It was just too dangerous. So, she is now unvaccinated. We also have a younger daughter, and she is fully vaccinated. She had a mild reaction to DtP once - her arm swelled up and caused a few hair raising hours of screaming that triggered all those bad memories for me. But it was just that, and it went away. Otherwise, no problems. I'm of 2 minds on the vaccine issue. First, I really need everyone to vaccinate their kids if they can. Because my daughter can't be, and if you choose not to just to prove what a hipster you are or to show how green you are or something, you're really, seriously, putting her (and other very sick kids) at risk of serious stuff. I think the vaccine / autism link has been well and truly shown to be false, and people who still believe it is true are seeing what they want to see. It really, really bothers me when people find out my daughter isn't vaccinated and then treat me (or her) like we're stupid or negligent because of it. They do this because there are a lot of stupid and negligent parents out there who aren't vaccinating. Be a good parent. Protect your kids. If not yours, protect your communty. On the other hand... I feel like I have no right to tell people they should vaccinate when we haven't. And we haven't because we experienced what they're all afraid of. So we're kind of the proof that yes, bad things sometimes do happen with vaccines. Also one of the things our doctors have assured us is that with modern medical care, getting measles or mumps is going to suck... but it won't kill my daughter. Even scarier diseases like diptheria or pertussis? Now that she's not an infant, and assuming we got medical care ASAP (which of course we would) her chances of survival are excellent. So when non-vaxers make the claim that the diseases that are vaccinated against generally aren't deadly: I believe them. I think they are only very dangerous if you are a fetus (rubella,) infant (pertussis,) or otherwise severely compromised in the immune department. Now, to me that's not a very good reason not to get a vaccine. But maybe to someone else it is. Maybe their child has risk factors for severe reactions like my daughter's that I don't know about. Who am I to judge? I don't know every person's back story, so I try not to say anything. That said, in a general sense? If (g)your child is healthy? Please, please go get them their shots. You will be protecting your child in a way that I can't protect mine. Trust me, from one mother to another, that is an incredibly hard thing to say, that you can't protect your child. I can't. You can. So do it. And in doing so, offer a measure of protection to the other children in your community who cannot be proteced by vaccines because of reactions, or AIDS, or cancer, or whatever else. I won't make the choice for you, but if you choose to do so? Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Embed Quote"

The foremost paper in this area is Economic Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases. Philipson argues that we have perceived benefits of vaccination based on the incidence and severity of disease. As incidence of a disease increases, the marginal benefit of prevention is great and so many people take action to prevent disease. Conversely, as diseases become more rare, our perceived marginal benefit for vaccination decreases, and so do vaccination rates. In essence, our behavior (whether or not to take a preventive action) changes in response to the prevalence of the preventable disease. So, to over-simplify things a bit... people don't get vaccinated (or get their kids vaccinated) because these diseases are rare.  Embed Quote"

While the amount of these ingredients have decreased over time (and are absent in some cases), many parents would prefer to not introduce toxins into their children's bloodstreamsBelief that there are some salutary effects of disease: some feel that exposure to illness as a child builds a healthier immune system later in lifeUnknown long term effects of vaccination: it may take many years to discover the long term effect of a vaccine. Case in point - there are long term risks of the chicken pox vaccine that are just coming out: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/2...Skepticism of the motives of vaccine providers: some feel that vaccine providers are driven by profit rather than by a genuine interest in the public good.Skepticism of the public health system that recommends vaccinations: some feel that vaccine requirements (in schools, camps, etc.) pushed by the government are infringements of liberty by entrenched bureaucracies in bed with the drug companiesA sense that we over vaccinate. Vaccines in the US are given for diseases that are rarely deadly (chicken pox) or pretty much not an issue in the US (polio).I think that the complexity of this issue is illustrated by the chicken pox vaccine. It has clearly been shown to reduce death by chicken pox in children from about 100 a year to about 10 per year in the US. However, how many of that difference of 90 came from people who didn't provide (or have access to) proper hospital care for their children? Use of the vaccine seems to increase longer term morbidity in people with weakened immune systems. What if, in 25 years, an additional 500 deaths per year are caused by use of the vaccine? Is it worth it then? If the vaccine costs about $100 for a series and there are about 4.5M children per year, it will cost about half a billion dollars  to vaccinate. Could that money be put to to use to save lives in a better way or is the lost productivity that parents incur when they have a child sick with chicken pox worth it? Tough questions.  Embed Quote"

However, it should be noted that ""natural"" mercury emissions are accounted as including re-emission of both anthropogenic and ""natural"" deposits, and that re-emission of previously anthropogenically-attributable mercury has been estimated to account for 50% of all ""natural"" land and ocean emissions into the atmosphere (Lindberg et al. 2007, pg. 20). So, mercury vapor entering the atmosphere from an open field would be counted as a ""natural"" emission, even if that mercury had been deposited in that field as a result of a nearby coal-fired power plant.Mercury cycles through the environment, so the question of where the mercury found in fish comes from depends on how many steps back you go. The short version is that mercury in fish comes from what they eat, including plants, crustaceans, and other fish. Mercury bioaccumulates up the food chain, which is why top predatory fish have higher concentrations than those at the bottom of the food chain. The mercury bioaccumulating up the food chain (and the one of major concern to human health) is methylmercury (MeHg), which has been converted from inorganic mercury by bacteria living at the sedimentary level. This methylmercury is then taken up by the marine food web, and also explains why bottom-dwelling animals tend to have higher mercury concentrations than you would otherwise expect.The mercury in sediment has settled from the water. Mercury enters the water from atmospheric and terrestrial deposition. There is run-off from surface deposits, direct dumping, settling of mercury-laden atmospheric particulates, mercury-laden rain, etc. A 2002 paper by Mason and Shau (see bottom of comment reference) estimated that atmospheric deposition into the oceans accounted for around 15.4 times that of surface deposition.According to a 2010 estimate by Pirrone et al., annual ""natural"" emissions to the atmosphere (including re-emission of anthropogenic emissions) totalled 5207 megagrams (5,207,000 kilograms), while annual anthropogenic emissions totalled 2320 megagrams (2,320,000 kilograms). The study found that ""fossil-fuel fired power plants, ferrous and non-ferrous metals manufacturing facilities, caustic soda production plants, ore processing facilities, incinerators for urban, medical and industrial wastes, cement plants and chemicals production facilities"" released significant amounts of mercury into the atmosphere, and that ""fossil fuel-fired power plants are the largest point sources of mercury released to the atmosphere"" (Pirrone et al. 2010, pg. 4726). It's also important to note that mercury concentrations are higher near their source, so fish living in an area close to coal-fired power plants are likely to have higher concentrations than those that are not. Deposits in sediment and elsewhere may also endure for a long time, so closure of a plant or other point source may not reduce risk for years or decades. My doctoral thesis, Fish Consumption, Mercury Intake, and the Associated Risks to the Kuwaiti Population, considers the past presence of a nearby chlorine and bleach processing plant that had used mercury cathodes as a possible contributor to mercury concentrations in fish in the Arabian Gulf, though the plant closed in the 1970s.I'll have a look for historical databases on mercury concentrations in fish and let you know if something comes up.

When I worked with my teen group in Peru, we used a series of hands-on activities to teach the ABC method. In English, it's the Abstinence, Be Faithful and use Condoms method. In Spanish, ABC stood for Abstinerse, Brindar fidelidad and Con protección. The purpose of our project was to prevent HIV through the use of peer educators.With the help of a really supportive school district, a great obstetra from the health post, a health-conscious mayor and some pretty awesome parents, we taught 40+ teens how to conduct activity-driven training sessions focused on how to prevent HIV that they then conducted with their own classmates. Every activity involved the full participation of the audience, and all the sessions were similarly structured to answer the following questions: What is HIV?What does it do to the body?How is it transmitted?How can we prevent it?Here are some examples of the activities we used. What is HIV? -> El Rompecabeza del VIH (HIV Puzzle)Students were given either a letter or a description, and they had to match them to each other. Once put together, the instructor would explain what the difference was between HIV and AIDS. What does it do to the body? -> El Sistema Inmunológico (The Immune System)This activity demonstrated how HIV attacks the immune system and leaves the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections, using some small drawings on cards and a volunteer. How is it transmitted? -> Si da, no da (Yes it's transmitted this way, no it's not)This activity required the students to guess what activities could put you at risk for HIV infection and which ones could not. Once all the cards were placed under ""Sí da"" or ""No da,"" the instructor went through the different cards one-by-one and asked the participants whether they thought it was in the right spot, guiding them to the correct conclusion. Once the ways HIV was spread were identified, they could then talk about how to prevent transmission.  How can it be prevented? -> La Carrera del Condón (Condom races)Instructors demonstrated the correct way to use a condom, and then the participants lined up to do a condom relay. Each member of each team would have to correctly put a condom on a green banana and then race back to tag the next team member. The first team to have everyone correctly place a condom on the banana won. This activity helped to involve every teen in the room to try to use a condom without having to worry about being singled out. When everyone had to do it, the teens were less likely to freeze with embarrassment.  There were many other activities that we conducted, depending on the group or time allotted. But the educational sessions always centered around first understanding WHY it was important to abstain or use condoms before addressing HOW to practice these techniques successfully. Once the teens learned how to conduct the activities, it was up to them to create the lesson plans and develop the materials they would need, as well as hand out the pre and post tests to measure how much their audience learned.  In addition to the educational sessions. The teenagers also worked on some media projects to help raise awareness of condom use, abstinence and fidelity. They made ""radio spots"" that were then broadcast over the town's loudspeaker, wrote skits for town gatherings, and painted murals. They even made a telenovela, a short fiction film that they wrote and starred in themselves that told the story of three friends and how they learned to prevent HIV. We were always careful to pause and ask them their thoughts, opinions and ideas on how best to make the message resonate with their peers.    Full disclosure: I have no idea if the use of peer educators helped to increase condom use overall in our community. But I do know that I saw a massive transformation in some of the peer educators. Over the course of the two-year project, I watched some really shy kids, terrified of asking those embarrassing questions, develop into confident, knowledgeable young adults who were interested in learning more about health in general. Some of them even went on to coordinate educational sessions with adults in their own neighborhoods. I don't know if it was the most effective way to teach condom use and abstinence, but I think it was worth doing. NOTE: For those interested in the specifics of some of our activities, you can message me directly.  Embed Quote"

It needs to be stored in a safe location for many years until it has spent itself. At that point, though, it can be handled safely. (I think it's on the order of ten years.)However, nuclear fuel is extremely efficient. You can generate a lot of power with a small amount of it. So you don't generate a lot of waste. And much less mining is needed for a given amount of power. Mining is a dangerous activity, so reducing it increases overall safety.Another safety issue: with proper engineering (container units, safety procedures, etc.) a meltdown is a relatively safe event—such as Three Mile Island, where the containing unit worked properly and no one was killed.This is all based on reading a book The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear, along with a visit to a canceled nuclear power plant near Seattle (mostly built, never operational). I might be getting some details wrong.  Embed Quote"

What's the truth?,"There is no such thing as ""safe energy.""  You’d be asking for gasoline that doesn’t burn. Just as a reminder: seven workers were injured — one with third-degree burns over 90% of his body — in Myrna, Georgia, in an explosion in a coal-fired power plant.  A cleaning chemical interacted with coal dust and caused ignition.  The press made no big deal of the coal-dust accident, nor does anybody normally write blaring headlines about hundreds of coal-mine accidents, refinery accidents, oil-well accidents, and natural gas explosions that regularly kill or maim the people who work to deliver energy to us.Nothing that involves a high concentration of energy and a low concentration can ever be completely safe. Energy is the ability to do work, and it may end up doing work you don't want it to do. Now here's the real problem: You feel you have been lied to, that somebody promised you breeder reactors are completely safe, or that other kinds of reactors are completely safe or something. Well, somebody lied to you all right, when they told you that any power generation could ever be completely safe.Read up on 'loss of blade' accidents for windmills, dam failures for hydro, and how coal releases radiation (lots of it) and other toxins (lots of them). Read up on what chemical compounds are used in solar cells, or just how hot a commercial sterling solar engine is at the mirror's focal point. Look at the political consequences of breeders, but also at the political consequences of the existing fuel oil demand. Look at the environmental consequences of nuclear, but also at the environmental consequences of big oil. Find out how even wave and tide, if scaled up to produce tens or hundreds of gigawatts, means thousands of small boat accidents a year, and probably many aquatic species will inevitably become extinct and whole ecologies will likely follow. For any power source, read up on where it is to be located, and the human costs of sending the power to where it is to be used.  Embed Quote"

Of course there are also other risks associated with nuclear power beyond just properly disposing of waste. What's the truth?,"Asking whether nuclear power is safe is the wrong question. The right one is: Is it safer than the alternatives?Bottom line, humanity isn't suddenly going to stop consuming vast amounts of energy. This energy needs to be available as cheaply and safely as possible, but in evaluating those properties, it's important to include all the effects.Coal, oil and gas are the main alternatives to nuclear in most locations. While seen as safer, the reality is quite a bit more complicated. There's no risk of a large scale meltdown scenario with fossil fuels, of course, but large quantities of radiation, mercury and other harmful substances, including C02, are released and do need to be considered when comparing total safety and cost with nuclear energy.Unfortunately, I haven't seen a full and solid comparison. You can get an idea by looking up studies on the by-products (e.g. nuclear waste and coal ash) by the EPA and others. A simple answer is not forthcoming, however, and it seems that every comparison is severely biased by whomever is conducting it.When comparing, it's also important to consider the type of nuclear power plant being proposed (when talking expansion). Modern nuclear reactors are significantly safer than the 30-40 year old reactors that dominate the US nuclear production facilities. Fast Breeder Reactors and Pebble Bed Reactors are two types it might be worthwhile to read up on.The distributed nature of the damage and cost of fossil fuel consumption makes it much more politically acceptable than nuclear, so it's doubtful that any change (whether or not it would make sense) will occur in the West any time soon.For a discussion on the costs of coal, see e.g.http://solveclimate.com/blog/200...The EPA also carried out a study on the dangers of coal ash (search for EPA coal ash study).  Embed Quote"

What's the truth?,"In light of the present situation in Japan, I will try to broach the subject of ""safety"" in a more delicate manner. The fact is, most energy-technology advances that mankind has harnessed since the start of the Industrial Revolution have carried a potential risk to human health. Nuclear power has, considering the years of continous delivery of energy and the few incidents of potential and/or realized danger to a population-- been one of the safest.Now consider the coal industry to feed Fossil-Fueled Steam Plants that are in daily use by the many thousands throughout the world. In the process of mining the coal to feed the plants, and for other heating or propulsion applications, there have been many, many deaths --going back to the late 1800's. A mine collapse or fire -- black lung disease, and so on. Even with the advent of the automobile, there were accepted risks by the users of this new transportation mode. They wore goggles to protect the eyes, ""car coats"" to protect themselves from the elements, and when there were accidents they were often very serious, if not fatal. Yes-- modern manufacturers have made the automobile much safer than in those days, but there is still risk attached to each and every use of the automobile-today.My point here is that there has never been an incorporating of a technology that would improve the living conditions of the masses, that did not have a price of increased risk attached to that incorporation. Will alternative energy sources prove to be statistically safer than Nuclear Power (for the same power output)?Possibly in 20-30 years. But for now let's just consider the fact that the record shows Nuclear Power to have caused far, far less death and injury than any other large-scale method of power generation Man has ever devised.  Embed Quote"

The public perception of the technology is therefore somewhat distorted, and sometimes bordering on hysterical (and the less informed people are about nuclear power, the more hysterical they tend to be). But it must be remembered that lessons were learned from those incidents, and nuclear power technology and the standards and practices that govern it have been continually improved and refined over the last few decades (the same cannot be said for other forms of power generation, incidentally). As an example of this, there is now a design of nuclear reactor that has the benefits of being far cheaper to build, far simpler in construction and operation (and therefore less prone to technical problems than more complex designs) and inherently safe, because it is self-moderating: it can never run out of control and trigger a meltdown, because the hotter the fuel gets, the less reactive it becomes. This is the Pebble Bed Reactor, and it promises to be able to provide cheap, safe, clean energy, without posing many of the same risks as more conventional reactors (not least of which is that of potentially providing the basis for nuclear weapons development by certain hostile regimes...)

What's the truth?,"Let's start with what most can agree on: 1) human error leading to systematic failure will always be possible; 2) disaster, when it does happen (and it will again), is not comparable to, say a wind turbine blade falling off -- nuclear accidents poison entire regions for generations; 3) energy coal has terrible human health effects, and more per year than nuclear if that is the metric you choose for comparison; 4) *nothing* is purely and inherently ""safe"" -- today's cheeseburger will kill me, eventually.None of that makes electricity generated by boiling water via nuclear fission a wise energy choice -- even given climate change's forcing our hand to get away from fossil fuels.Professionals in nuclear energy will disagree, as they have a lot invested in the -- yes, advancing -- technologies involved. The majority of them do no live near the Davis-Besse power plant, which, in 2002, was discovered to have a giant hole in the reactor head eaten away for years by dripping acid. Postponed NRC inspections (delayed at the request of the operator) failed to bring this near-catastrophe to light. You can joke that ""We almost lost Toledo"" isn't that much of a concern, but it is to we Ohioans.Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (image of hole in reactor head)Professionals in nuclear energy think anti-nuclear activists are ignorant of the technology and cost-benefit and risks involved, questions on which they all come down in favor of nuke power; they call our concerns ""irrational"" despite having no sound, long-lasting solution for managing the enormous, massive amounts of waste generated. So let's set all that aside and look disinterestedly at the economics of it.If nuclear power were both safe and cost-effective, wouldn't countries all over the world be building new plants? Yet even in France too much trepidation about it in the private sector prevents new investment. Here in the U.S., we aren't seeing new construction despite the Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act which since 1957 has given federal protection to only this one means of energy production.  That act alone ought to answer the question: How safe can nuclear energy be if no company will invest in it without a federal guarantee that ""coverable accidents"" will have cleanup funded by the U.S. government.If nuclear power is safe, private insurers would insure construction and operation of plants.  They've never had to.The risk of major disaster is so high, nobody in industry would ever touch nuclear power without this federal giveaway.We don't even need to bring up the terrorist scenario argument; in summer 2011 a nuclear power facility in Nebraska flooded, caught fire, and was shut down thanks to nothing more than severe flooding of the Missouri River. It's still shut down. As of fall 2012, it's still closed, AFAIK.Here is what we in the nuclear safety community say when comparisons with coal come up. No nukes, no coal, no kidding:http://www.nirs.org/factsheets/n...UPDATE: ""[I]n the US from 2002 to 2012 over 50,000 megawatts of wind were deployed. Not one megawatt of power from new nuclear reactors was deployed, despite subsidies estimated to be worth more than the value of the power new reactors would have produced. Similarly, it took 40 years globally to deploy 50,000 megawatts of solar PV and, recently, only 2 ½ years to deploy an equal amount.

Of course there are also other risks associated with nuclear power beyond just properly disposing of waste. What's the truth?,"No, because technologies and people that use them are not separate entities.With every technology there are economic and social difficulties. To ensure that nuclear tech is properly handled, properly engineered, you need to have a concerned citizenry that's capable of enforcing safety measures.Chernobyl did not have the right social organization around it, so it was engineered and handled poorly. Uranium mines can be in any country and developing countries aren't capable of enforcing safety measures on them. Even in developed countries like Australia, France and Germany there are noticeable problems with uranium mining, mostly caused by economic forces. An interesting documentary on that is ""Uranium Is A Country"" http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/u...Current nuclear technology requires too many things to go right. A safe technology should be stupid simple to setup safely and require little or no government oversight to maintain safety. Oversight slowly crumbles against financial motivations.There are new nuclear technologies in development that are simpler and recycle waste from current nuclear plants. The current waste has a ~10,000 year half life and after use in new plants it will have a ~500 year half life. We'll probably be building such powerplants if only to ease the nuclear waste problem.Safety problems can crop up in any industry that depends on complex engineering, perfect maintenance and economics for it. The airline industry has worn down regulation on regional flights in the USA and safety has suffered as a result. With energy technology few people ever see the environmental damage, (power-plants and mines are in sparsely populated areas) which makes it that much easier to get away with it.Nuclear can be compared with coal and oil in it's safety record and engineering and management complexity required to maintain safety. But compared to solar and wind the old technologies are a safety headache.  Embed Quote"

Though Zyklon B was initially conceived as a pesticide, it is severely toxic to all forms of animal life, a fact which was later put to one of the most infamous uses in history by the Nazis, who used Zyklon B as the primary poison in the gas chambers at Dachau, Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and elsewhere.However, the toxicity of Zyklon B to humans was well-known prior to its use by the Nazis. That's what makes the fact that it was knowingly used to spray down immigrants entering El Paso from Juarez, as described in Ringside Seat to a Revolution: An Underground Cultural History of El Paso and Juarez, 1893-1923, so odious.In 1917, Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Immigration Act - http://library.uwb.edu/guides/US... , and the U.S. Public Health Service published a ""Manual for the Physical Inspection of Aliens"" (there was also a ""Manual for the Mental Inspection of Aliens"" -http://www.dnalc.org/view/11482-... - and a few other official publications). All of these developments were brought about by the rising fears spurred by the eugenicists of the day over cross-border infection by ""aliens."" as well as by a more general desire to keep anyone ""defective"" out of America. Listed reasons for barring entrance included, at various times, people with such conditions as ""arthritis, asthma, bunions, deafness, deformities, flat feet, heart disease, hernia, hysteria, poor eyesight, poor physical development, spinal curvature, vascular disease of the heart, and varicose veins."" Elsewhere, ""imbeciles, idiots, feeble-minded person, persons of constitutional psychopathic inferiority (homosexuals), vagrants, physical defectives, chronic alcoholics, polygamists, anarchists, persons afflicted with loathsome or dangerous contagious diseases, prostitutes, contracts laborers, all aliens over 16 who cannot read"" were all to be prohibited entry into the USA.Those last two - contract laborers and aliens over 16 who cannot read - were aimed squarely at the nation's southern border immigrants. As a result, U.S. Public Health Service Agents deloused a reported 127,123 Mexicans in a zealous effort to comply with the new regulations. And, by ""deloused,"" that means (in addition to ""bathing"" the immigrants (harsh scrubbing, often in either kerosene or vinegar), the Public Health Agents sprayed the clothes of these 100,000+ immigrants with Zyklon B.Unfortunately, the gaseous form of Zyklon B can be absorbed directly through the skin - that's one of the reasons the Nazis used it - and it is fatal - not just toxic, but FATAL - to humans when absorbed through the skin at a concentration of 50 ppm or above. While there are no known records of living people actually being directly sprayed with Zyklon B (of which I'm aware, at any rate), what kind of exposure resulted from putting back on one's clothes after having them sprayed heavily with Zyklon B? In the above-linked book, the author laments that he has only oral and anecdotal histories and evidence for the results of such routine, widespread use of such a deadly toxin, but he estimates that all effects taken together (birth defects, cancers, deaths) ""may well run into the tens of thousands."" Of human beings. I'd say that's got to rank as one of the worst abuses in the name of ""public health"" in this country's history, at least.  Embed Quote"

In fact, cooking is a relatively recent phenomenon. The first somewhat well-accepted evidence for cooking comes from the presence of burnt bones and tools at Zhoukoudian, China, between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago in what was probably a very late H. erectus site. Thus, all hominids before a certain date probably ate entirely raw food. (""Hominid Use of Fire in the Lower and Middle Pleistocene"" by Steven R. James, Current Anthropology (1989) gives a good, if outdated, review of the origins of cooking and other fire use.) In fact, until recently, there were Inuit groups that went through multiple seasons in a year eating almost nothing but raw, frozen, or fermented meat.To be clear, though, there have been no modern human populations other than today's raw-foodists who have gone entirely without cooking. Anthropologists like Richard Wrangham use this as evidence that cooking may be an obligatory human behavior, controversially claiming that ""people who choose a 'raw-foodist' life-style experience low energy and impaired reproductive function"" (""Cooking as a biological trait"", Wrangham, 2003).There are a few disadvantages to not cooking:Parasites: It's easy to underestimate how big of a problem parasites are, even today. Billions of people worldwide are infected by parasites, many from either unclean water or improperly prepared food. Parasite larvae tend to spend a lot of time embedded in animal tissues (like muscle) and plants, while adult stages will spend a lot of time in animal organs. Infestation with parasites is a major cause of malnutrition and death worldwide, and without proper regulations, transmission through raw food is distinct possibility, while thorough cooking will kill most parasites. The Inuit mentioned above probably have a smaller chance of getting parasites due to the climate, but protozoan and helminth infections were and continue to be a problem among many Inuit. The human digestive tract is resilient, but going for years eating nothing but unregulated raw food will take its toll.It's hard to eat raw food: Or at least, for a good part of hominid history it was. Early hominids specialized to eat tough plant matter had enormous jaws and huge sagittal crests to attach the powerful muscles needed to grind their food. (To be fair, much of the reduction in jaw size since then was caused by changes in the content of diet rather than the preparation.) Chewing this tough plant material caused many hominids' teeth to be worn down to the gums. (Again, to be fair, much of this was caused by the fact that for a long time, teeth were used as tools, which caused a lot of wear.) These early hominids also probably had digestive tracts better equipped to deal with raw food. The point is that if you are committed to eating raw food, it's not guaranteed that there will always be soft raw food available, and eating tougher food without cooking it takes a lot of effort. Some people believe that cooking has caused such a dramatic reduction in jaw size that it's a major cause of orthodontic malocclusion today (""The adaptive value of dental crowding"", A. V. Lombardi, 1982).To give a dramatic illustration, take a look at the enormous molars on this jaw of P. boisei, a hominid specialized to eat tough plant matter:In the past, people who ate only raw food would probably have a somewhat shortened life-span due to the disadvantages outlined above. But these are mostly negated by the advantages that modern raw foodists have:Reduced exposure to parasites: Because of food regulations in the developed world, it's much less likely that you'll get many of the common food parasites than it was before, although you still have to be careful.Unprecedented access to a variety of foods: Sure, when you're living on the African savannah, living off of raw food may be tough, but in America, we import and grow food from all over the world. Surely, anyone can find enough foods to meet their nutritional requirements and suit their tastes - at least if they're willing to pay enough. And we've developed techniques and foods that make things much easier to eat than the tough plant matter our ancestors used to eat.Health: I know far too little about raw food diets to make any claims about their health benefits, but practitioners of these diets claim, among other things, that it preserves vitamins and enzymes. (As with any other dietary advice, take the claims with a grain of salt and look at what the evidence says.)In short, it should be made perfectly obvious that humans can survive on raw food alone, based on the fact that thousands, if not millions, of people have done it and are doing it. Whether or not this is desirable is up to you to decide.  Embed Quote"

Also, babies don't die from breastfeeding for three months...

There are a few things that make a disease a good candidate for eradication, and HPV doesn't quite fit the bill.What makes a disease a good candidate?1. The disease is highly visible. Small pox, for example, was a pretty tough disease to hide. The signature rash appeared all over the body in a spiral pattern, starting with the extremities and working their way around. You can see in the image below that the rash concentrated in some of the most visible places: the head, hands and feet. You couldn't miss it.  Image from: CDC Smallpox | Smallpox Overview2. The symptoms are unique. Many diseases look alike. It's much harder to beat a disease if it's not easily identified. The rash for small pox was characteristic. For the most part, people knew what it was and -- most importantly -- what to look for.  3. There is a short incubation period. This is the period of time between the moment a person is infected and the onset of symptoms. Measles, for example, is highly visible and has a characteristic rash, but it has a fairly long incubation period (10-12 days), and a person can become contagious before the symptoms are apparent. The shorter the incubation period, the faster cases can be identified and contained. 4. It is transmitted human-to-human. That is, there isn't something that carries the pathogen (the thing that causes disease) from person to person -- or a ""vector"" -- and no other animal can serve as a host. Yellow fever, for example, can live in both humans and monkeys, and is spread by mosquitoes. So if we did end up successfully eliminating yellow fever in humans, it's possible it could reemerge via the monkey-mosquito route if we let our immunity wane. Image from: A List of Some Vector Diseases 5. There is an effective method of preventing transmission. More often than not, this refers to an effective vaccine that provides lifelong immunity. With smallpox, one shot could protect most people for the rest of their lives. 6. It is stable. This means that it doesn't change easily. Viruses, especially, are prone to antigenic drift (changing little by little over time) or antigenic shift (changing in a big way very quickly). If the pathogen continues to morph, you're aiming at a moving target. Image from: Rule of 6ix: November 2011 Some other factors to consider for a good eradication candidate: 7. There are sufficient resources. Eradication has a HUGE return on investment, but the investment is pretty substantial. Significant resources need to be poured into eradication programs for them to work. Billions of dollars have been spent on the polio eradication campaign, and now the disease is only in three countries. But if resources were to be scaled back, polio could easily spread across the globe again. Concentrating those resources is critical.  8. There is enough political will. The world is increasingly interconnected. People can literally fly around the world in a single day. It takes massive coordination from the world's governing powers to make sure that everyone works in tandem. So ... how does HPV measure up against these characteristics?Highly visible? | No. Most people with HPV don't even know they are infected and show no symptoms. Unique symptoms? | Yes and no.  As I mentioned, most HPV infections result in no symptoms. Some strains of HPV can cause genital warts, however, and these are pretty characteristic. I'll spare you a graphic picture, but they are likened to cauliflower. Short incubation period? | No.  The incubation period varies widely, depending on the HPV sub type, but all estimates are long, typically ranging from one month to years. Human-to-human transmission? | Yes. Humans are the only known, natural hosts of HPV. Effective prevention method? | Yes and no. We have safe and effective vaccines; however, the vaccines can only protect against 2 or 4 HPV sub types (depending on the vaccine brand). Both vaccines prevent the two types of HPV responsible for the vast majority of HPV-related cancers, and one of the vaccines prevents the two sub types responsible for nearly all genital warts. But there are more than 100 different sub types of HPV, and roughly 40 that affect the genital area. We have no practical way to prevent the other subtypes. Even condoms don't fully protect against HPV. Is it stable? | Fairly so, yes. HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus, so it doesn't change as much as an RNA virus might. Sufficient resources? | Probably not. To start, HPV is REALLY, REALLY common. Nearly all sexually active adults become infected with HPV at some point in their lifetime -- in large part, because many people don't even know they are infected and so continue to spread it. What's more the vaccine requires three doses, months apart, to provide full protection. Tackling HPV would require massive, and I mean massive amounts of money and manpower. Political will? | Unlikely. People don't like talking about sexually transmitted infections, least of all politicians. Eradicating the four sub types included in the HPV4 vaccine would take nearly universal vaccination in every country on the planet, and there would still be 96+ sub types left circulating. Perhaps if we were able to develop a universal HPV vaccine that protected against every sub type for life, eradication would be feasible. But given the technology and biological considerations that we have today, HPV is just not a reasonable candidate for eradication.

It is, however, heavily influenced by medical organizations - especially the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).The current official position of the AAMC, however, is that we are indeed heading towards a shortage of physicians in the U.S., and they have urged the DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services) to increase their funding ceiling for residency positions. Here are the AAMC's own projections:As for specialty societies, there are strict prohibitions on discussion of resident manpower issues by centers around the country, precisely because of the risk of monopolistic behavior (or its appearance). The U.S. Department of Labor would agree with the coming undersupply of physicians:All these groups have a major challenge: changing the number of medical school or residency slots will bear fruit in 10+ years. It is not easy to predict a market demand that many years away.3. meanwhile, there has been a huge rise in ""physician extender"" professions such as Physician Assistants (PA) and Nurse Practitioners (NP)Physician productivity has gone up tremendously with the rise over the last decade of professions that act as ""physician extenders"" such as PA's:and of NP's:Canada is now taking a serious look at growing its own PA and NP workforces as well.4. the physician shortage in the U.S. may in fact be mostly a shortage of general practitioners (and possibly an oversupply of specialists)Total supply of physicians has risen only slowly in the U.S. since 1990 - but the same can be said of most advanced countries:Where the U.S. is drastically different from other OECD nations is in the number of general practitioners we have:5. at the same time, there is also a maldistribution problem in the U.S. - an oversupply of doc's in desirable locations, and terrible undersupply in other areas.The federal government has recognized this for a long time, and has taken some measures to try and alleviate this maldistribution:6. bringing in international medical graduates (IMG's) has been a help for some time now...

And this comes from a guy who would love to see more doctors trained even if his future salary ""suffered"".First, a little mythbusting: the AMA does not accurately represent the American physician community, and whether it ever has is quite questionable. A quick look at their membership numbers from 2010 confirms this: only ~216K out of 814K+ licensed physicians were AMA members (~26%).

Running an anatomy lab with adequate safety/sanitary precautions, preservation capacity to keep a dead body in reasonable condition for months/years, and enough supply of bodies to educate med students at a reasonable ratio of 1 body for every 4-6 learners is no easy feat. Cremation/burial of the bodies needs to be taken into account as well. If you think anatomy labs can be sidestepped by using advanced computer simulations, you are mistaken. If you disagree, think about how comfortable you'd feel knowing your surgeon had only been trained with bodies on a computer screen.Physical space is limited. For lectures, sure, just shove more people into an auditorium and it'll work. Not so for clinical rotations where students join teams of physicians to learn the craft of patient care. I work in the largest medical center in the world, and hospital space is STILL tight; there are only so many students that can learn in a single hospital without their presence becoming a legitimate barrier to good healthcare. We have to share space with attendings, residents, nurses and their students, physical therapists and their students, respiratory therapists and their students, pharmacists and their students, etc. Oh, and patients. And their families.Residency limitations. Even if you increased the number of spots per med school, that really doesn't fix the problem. You'd also have to increase the number of residency spots, where every freshly minted physician spends 3-8 years honing their skills. Guess what all those spots are funded by? Medicare. Ouch. Those are not fun legal waters, friend. Even so, residency positions have been growing, just not at an ideal rate.This has more to do with the funds available to Medicare than the AMA--Medicare money has effectively been growing smaller every year, making it very difficult to increase spots given that each spot requires, at minimum, a few hundred thousand dollars. I support the assertion that more doctors would be great--but where would the money come from? Also, I'd like to see more convincing proof that the AMA is to blame for this ""cap"" (...which has been growing?) than a citation-less argument in a Forbes article from an author whose main goal is pageviews.Building a new med school is no easy feat. It will need hospitals nearby. Not just that, those hospitals have to be willing to serve as teaching grounds for students/residents--an endeavor that will cost them. Building a brand new hospital sizeable enough to have all the specialties needed to teach med students adequately? That's at least a few hundred million green ones you'll need to scare up. Again, where would the money come from? More taxes? In our current political environment especially?Assuming we have these hospitals, there need to be physicians willing to teach med students.

The training is long and costly – the hours long and brutal – the documentation and paperwork and fear of litigation are ever overshadowing the reward of excellent patient care and healing. You have to have enormous psychological and physical reserve to survive a tough residency.People look at me wide eyed with a combination of respect and disbelief when I tell them what I do, and how little I sleep. If you calculate my hourly wage (divide my salary by the number of hours I work) it is well below minimum wage. That’s for the next 5-7 years at least. I could make more money doing literally anything else. And I graduated at the top of my class from college and medical school. You get the picture.But at the end of the day, as hard as it is – what I get to do with my days is a gift. It’s a privilege that I even have the opportunity to do what I do. And, yes – I’m one of the crazy ones who actually believes I can change the system, and heal a few people along the way too.Our country needs more doctors – in particular, we need more generalists. That means we have to create both economic and lifestyle incentives for people to go into those fields. We also need more physician extenders (those Nurse Practitioners, and Physician Assistant) who can prevent basic, preventative health services to a wider population at a cheaper cost. These extenders can also share the increasing workload of hospital residents (as our hours are restricted more and more), making our lives easier during the day and helping us focus on learning the highly technical skills that set us apart as MDs.Doctors are expensive to train and pay, bottom line. We need to train more people to do it -- but we also need to be sure we're training people with the right motivations, expectations, and above all, a commitment to high quality care.  Embed QuoteVia  Mircea Goia."

Espada has 20 years' experience dealing in the financial aspects of medical student admissions and the resulting medical-resident matching process.In his view, the answer to the question is very basic: there are limited funds for training medical residents. It is important to know that, for the most part, training hospitals rely on federal dollars to fund their residency programs. In our state, residency programs are supported by Medicaid.To put it simply, as federal funds for graduate medical education (GME) shrink, so will the supply of physicians.Groups like the American Academy of Family Physians have been aware of the problem for some time:http://www.aafp.org/online/en/ho....Of course, physician groups are lobbying for change: http://medicalxpress.com/news/20...And the Affordable Care Act would reform how federal funds for GME are distributed: http://www.im.org/AcademicAffair...Is the GME funding problem being properly addressed by the feds? That sounds like another question for Quora.  Embed QuoteVia  Mircea Goia."

To the former, there is unquestionably evidence that there are physician shortages.  To the latter, I do not think it's necessary to bring up monopolies, since there are too many forces in the system to result in monopolistic control. A more direct and more pragmatic answer arises by simply considering the cost/benefit seen by prospective doctors considering entering medicine.  The number of physicians is dictated by the balance between the attractiveness of being a practicing physician -- compensation, respect, autonomy -- and the forces working against this -- medical school timeline/costs, malpractice insurance costs, intrusion by healthcare reform, and uncertainty in the future of medicine. In order for us to train more physicians, we have to address both sides and to some degree this must be done simultaneously. If the government determined it was sufficient priority to add more physicians, it could seek to reduce the hurdles to becoming a physician (offering tax breaks, subsidies, etc., to med schools and students) and reduce the challenges to being a physician (e.g., regulate healthcare insurance and medical malpractice in favor of physicians).  But in an era of increased pressure/noise for government to be smaller, this centralized planning approach does not have many supporters.  Other sources of ""control"" in the number of trained physicians could be medical schools and healthcare systems, both of which have a vested interest in the number and quality of physicians. However, each of these operates independently, which limits their collective ability to raise the number of physicians. To the extent that these independently motivated entities concur on the lack of physicians, there will be movement to sway the cost/benefit in favor of more physicians.  Free market forces will otherwise determine what moves each entity makes in affecting the number of physicians.  Embed QuoteVia  Mircea Goia."

Tamas's and Jae Won Job's wonderful answers is in order ( they do raise some good points - I have nothing against them ) :DLaszlo B. TamasMonopolistic Schools/ResidenciesUniversities as a cohort aren't monopolistic necessarily, they try to serve market demand just like any other ""company"".Indeed that doubling you speak of is the universities serving the market.The rise in the number of graduations is in correlation to the number of applications.The sharp stagnation the questioner refers to occurred after the number of applications leveled off ( gradual gradient ) after the mid 70s. However, the applications once again cycled up - Why did the universities not respond with a corresponding increase in supply (graduates)?It is because the limiting reagent is the number of residencies, not the schools. Jae Won Johconspiracy theories that abound regarding doctor pay and artificial limiting of spots seem a bit absurd. I don't believe it's a conspiracy or anything nefarious in any way shape or form.I do think it's just a simple case of mixed incentives - like investment bankers who take risk and get the upside without the downside ( you know how that goes ).Just look at the graph above from the same site you got your AMA info from. That's 20 years of American population and GDP growth without any increase in the number of graduates. Are you seriously stating that there are no artificial limitations that cap graduates below market demand? a whopping 77% of doctors say the AMA does NOT represent their viewsWhether or not they represent the ""views"" of doctors is not relevant. The question is this: Is there a market shortage?The graph above seems to indicated there is, along with the above market rates US doctors receive compared to other OECD countries....

If fewer new doctors are trained, existing doctors make more money. I'm not saying it's a conspiracy, or even a conscious decision. But it's still a strong economic incentive for most of the people involved in the decision, so it's not at all surprising the decision has gone this way.Even if you remove the economic part of it, there's also a matter of pride that works the same way. Imagine you're a doctor - you worked hard to get your job, you know how important your job is, you know lots of other people with this job that you think highly of, and you believe you do much better at the job than some random borderline med school candidate. Therefore you're conservative in who else you think should be allowed to be a doctor. This is a very reasonable point of view, not at all malicious and certainly not a conspiracy. But it leads to there being fewer doctors than the market would produce otherwise, so if we want more doctors we need to recognize it and account for it.  Embed Quote"

There's several reasons for it.One reason is that back in the 1970s and 1980s, it was predicted that there would be too many doctors in the US. This upset some doctors and the AMA, which feared income would go down. AAMC, which represents med schools, was put under pressure to shrink the class sizes nationwide. In 1994, the Journal of the American Medical Association predicted a surplus of 165,000 doctors by 2000. For years the official position was that an ""oversupply exists or is immediately expected."" The LCGME in the 1980s realized that there were 2 new doctors for every one that retired, and lobbied both schools and the government to reduce the number of seats. Existing schools shrank their class sizes, and the federal government cut the budget to control the number of residencies. When the population increased more than expected due to immigration and higher life expectancy, and more doctors started retiring at a younger age, they realized their mistake. AAMC has asked schools to increase enrollment by 15%, but this is harder to do now because of budget issues; every new student needs more professors, dorms, cadavers, financial aid, etc. Many alternatives are popping up to address the issue; more DO schools, Caribbean medical schools, more PAs and NPs etc.  Embed Quote"

These private colleges recieve lots of subsidies on every infrastructure required to run these institutes. In return, they are regulated by the Government bodies to keep the fees low, so that the student  can afford to study there. However, the greedy Trustees take huge sums of money from the medical aspirants for admission to these colleges. For example, the capitation fees can range from 25 lakhs to 5 crore rupees (40,000$ to 8,00,000$) depending on the college and the degree offered. And these are under the table transactions which everyone is aware of, but is not on paper. Now, the amount of capitation fees (nee bribe) will depend on the forces of demand and supply in play. If the Government colleges and their student enrollment are increased, it would result in lower bribes to these private institutions, which are wholly owned by the politicians and their friends in the name of various trusts. So, the politicians have an incentive to NOT increase the number of seats in the Government colleges. Thus, Indian government spends a very miniscule part of its GDP on healthcare; lesser still in healthcare education. Infact, the actual number of Government residencies have gone down since the past decade, and the chances of them increasing substantially are very low, atleast in the near future.  Embed Quote"

By lying to include yourself in the population of blood donors, you decreased the perceived need to expand the blood supply by reviewing outdated rules. You also help to overstate the percentage of the currently eligible population that is donating.What you create - one pint of blood for someone to receive - is unlikely to make the difference between life and death for an individual anyway. The average transfusion is 3 pints, and the chances of a blood shortage are very low. Plus, half the blood supply is separated and not given as whole blood anyway.A more appropriate way to deal with this discrimination is to work to rescind this outdated rule. Gays that openly flout this rule actually hurt the chances of it being changed.[1]: http://www.americasblood.org/go....  Embed Quote"

In the early 1980s there were cases where people received tainted blood transfusions and contracted HIV. HIV tests weren't as reliable, and the main group of HIV+ people were men who'd had sex with men (MSM). In order to safeguard the blood supply, the FDA decided to exclude all MSM from being allowed to donate blood. Last year the FDA reviewed this policy and found that allowing all MSM to donate blood would increase the likelihood of HIV being in the blood supply by 500%. The FDA decided that this was not a risk worth taking, and so continued the current policy. There are alternatives to this policy, for example only allowing people who have not had male-male sex within the past year (this ensures that HIV is more likely to be found by testing) which would increase the likelihood of HIV being in the blood supply by 60%. Any decision on the ethics of donating blood must be made with this in mind. It is entirely unethical to increase the likeliness of someone contracting HIV from being transfused your blood. You have said that you are sure that you're clean (HIV-). As long as you and your sex partners have been tested every 3 months, and haven't had new sex partners in that time (to re-start the 3-month window), then it can be said that you belong to a subgroup of MSM who has reduced their risk of HIV to that of the rest of the population. Since you are then not increasing the chance of someone contracting HIV from being transfused your blood, it is ethical for you to lie and give blood. Some personal examples... 1) Once I was old enough to donate blood I started donating blood every few months. Then in college I (gay) got a boyfriend, and he and I were no longer eligible to donate blood. When the blood drive came on campus, though, we went with our friends and donated blood together. By having a closed circle of people we'd had sex with (me and him) we knew that there was no likelihood of being HIV+, and so we felt it was entirely ethical to donate. The years have passed, the boyfriends have changed, and while I am still HIV- and am tested when it makes sense to, I no longer donate blood. I haven't convinced myself if it's ethical in my specific case (I feel I am not increasing anyone's likelihood of contracting HIV, but I am a member of a high risk class). 2) Also in college, a long time straight friend of mine joined us in bed. ""You guys seem to enjoy this sex with men, that beer tasted good, sure I'll give it a try."" Isn't college fun? The FDA question asks, ""Have you had sex, even once, with another man since 1977?"" Well yes he did, one time, 10 years ago. Nobody's risk of contracting HIV is increased from his actions, and so he finds it ethical to lie every time he donates blood, and will continue to do so for decades to come. ----------Further reading from the FDA, though it doesn't seem to have been updated with the stats from the last time the FDA deliberated on this in 2010: http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloo...  Embed Quote"

Just wanted to add into the mix this article: http://www.slate.com/id/2257655/...which brings into question these policies based on the relative risks of allowing various populations to donate blood. The author notes that though MSMs are more likely to be HIV-infected than others, the majority of those who are infected know that they are carrying the disease. However, among black men, who were less likely to be infected than MSMs, but more likely than the general population, the majority of infected individuals did not know that they were infected. Assuming that a person who knew that he or she had HIV would not try to donate blood, this makes the relative risks from the MSM and the black populations comparable. If this is the case (and I admit, I have not checked the math), blood from a gay man (especially one who has been regularly tested) would fall within a range of risk that the FDA has implicitly deemed acceptable. I don't see anything unethical about that.  Embed Quote"

Very seldom do people saying it mean the same thing that everyone hearing it reads. It's often used interchangeably with ""moral"" or ""right/correct"" and the confusion around meaning engenders a lot of debate.I really rather like the delineation here as it rings true: http://ww.scu.edu/ethics/practic...so I'm going to use it as a basis for my answer. What, then, is ethics? Ethics is two things. First, ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues. Ethics, for example, refers to those standards that impose the reasonable obligations to refrain from rape, stealing, murder, assault, slander, and fraud. Ethical standards also include those that enjoin virtues of honesty, compassion, and loyalty. And, ethical standards include standards relating to rights, such as the right to life, the right to freedom from injury, and the right to privacy. Such standards are adequate standards of ethics because they are supported by consistent and well-founded reasons.Secondly, ethics refers to the study and development of one's ethical standards. As mentioned above, feelings, laws, and social norms can deviate from what is ethical. So it is necessary to constantly examine one's standards to ensure that they are reasonable and well-founded. Ethics also means, then, the continuous effort of studying our own moral beliefs and our moral conduct, and striving to ensure that we, and the institutions we help to shape, live up to standards that are reasonable and solidly-based. There are those who will zero in on the word ""honesty"" in that first paragraph and if that is the sole determinant? Then lying is unethical.But the reason I like this definition is that it focuses on the bigger picture as well as the smaller elements. There are societal standards *and* personal standards.  The article suggests (and I concur) that at times, a society's standards can be unethical or become corrupted.  In such a case, one's own moral code of conduct trumps that of the standards set by the society.In this case, it sounds as if you have decided that the good of donating blood and the lives that may save outweighs the out-moded standard of denying someone the opportunity to donate blood simply by virtue of their sexual-orientation. If I believe (as I do) that the standard is wrong, then yes - I believe that someone lying about their sexual partners in that instance is ethical.So yes, by that rationale it is ethical. Honest? No. Ethical, yes.  Embed Quote"

(I don't think donating as a political statement makes sense either.)Nucleic acid testing (a term encompassing both DNA and RNA) with PCR amplification can detect even a single instance of viral genetic material in a whole sample. Some of the sources cited above are from before the nucleic acid testing era. The only problematic one is Anon User quoting a 2010 FDA review as saying 500% but not giving details for interpretation or the source. That user does link a 2006 FDA conference, and skimming the PDF of that so far seems to support the contention that risk is insignificant.  Embed Quote"

There is a long questionnaire, and some of the questions seem to be pointless. There are plenty of opportunities to lie. But I don't. Nobody should. The blood banks set up the screening to protect both the donors and the recipients. The ban on MSM donors might be outdated, but it's the job of the FDA to review the science and make that decision. The system errs on the side of caution, and I think that's wise, because of the potential consequences to the recipients.If you have problems with the ban, there are much more prudent things to do. The blood bank I used had an out for people who felt peer pressure to donate, but knew they shouldn't: mark a checkbox and your donated blood would not be used. Very discreet.If you are donating because you want to help make sure there is adequate blood for people who need it, you can encourage others to donate. I have run office blood drives, and got many people to donate for the first time.If you think the ban is wrong-headed, find a way to pressure the FDA. I'm sure there are groups already doing that.In any case, please, nobody should lie on those forms, about any of those questions. To answer your question directly, yes, it is unethical. Even if you think you should be an exception to the rule. You don't know all the research and reasoning that went on behind the scenes to decide which questions to include. (And it's ongoing: the list of questions changes over time.) The integrity of the blood supply is too important--the people who need the blood are already taking enough risks.  Embed Quote"

(since these are pretty much the kinds of ethical systems we have to work with)Reciprocity is, in my opinion, only sufficient as a first approximation.  You should definitely subject yourself to any judgement that you would impose on another.Would you give your loved one, your child, or yourself blood from a gay person?Yes, I would.  You clearly would.  What about other people?  I think we can unequivocally say that there are people who would, sadly, not make this choice.And however ignorant, irrationally fearful, bigoted, and/or small-minded that choice might be; we have to consider if we would want others to take away a similar choice from ourselves (under different circumstances obviously).Sometimes I think this is the right answer (for example, with the abolition of slavery).What are the consequences of this action?  I think some others have made a pretty good argument that the blood supply is relatively ok without your donation and, it's possible, by tricking the system you are harming the greater cause.Fair enough, I think, but it's not certain.On what Authority do you undertake this action?  Personal vendetta?  They are wrong and I'll show them?   I think my reservation here would be that you are proposing a form of secret 'Civil disobedience'.  But I think that Civil disobedience really needs to be an open, collective act with an expectation of consequences for it to be effective or legitimate (or risk vigilantism).Counterpoint, the underground railroad.WINNING, or Do As Thou Wilt, or perhaps these are opposites?Is there a better resolution possible, more in line with your True Will (whatever that might mean to you) - or is this a more base desire, shorter-sighted?There is one final consideration I would give, one that seems more reliable than the others, and that is Informed Cooperation (if not consent).  When we impose our will on others, we owe them, at the very least, their say in the matter.  We might choose to ignore it in the end, but they should have it and they should be aware of it.I would propose that an action is not ethical when it is imposed on an independent being without at least knowing their will (and having a reasoned and well-evidenced justification for ignoring it if need be).[if someone is incapacitated or incapable of expression then they are not fully independent, where their will is reasonably inferable action may be justified; this applies to infants and children to the degree they are capable]On this point I think we fail because those subjected to your choice would not be informed of it so you lack either consent or an informed subject.So I would say this is probably not a highly ethical action.  Sorry.However, I do fully support overturning the ban - I would rather see a risk assessment methodology that more accurately reflects the risk and mitigation factors fairly for all blood units and I do not believe it does today.  Embed Quote"

If there is a structure built on the surface, then the TCE will accumulate in the air inside the structure. This problem is especially acute for homes, since people spend so much of their lives in their homes, but it can be a problem for workplaces as well.Interestingly, TCE in the air outside of structures is apparently not a problem (TCE is detectable, but at the same level elsewhere in the Bay Area). It sounds like Google and Symantec are circulating outdoor air into their buildings in order to mitigate TCE buildup. But note that this ""ventilation"" is not the same as ""air filtration"". I've never heard that filtering air is an effective way of removing TCE.For homes, the only recommended solution I've ever heard is a ""vapor barrier"": a TCE-impermiable barrier between the soil and the house. Obviously, that's very difficult to install under an existing building. I think only buildings built in the late-90s or later will have them, and that's only a very few buildings in the area (and basically none of the apartment buildings).I personally would not live in a home inside the MEW plume area, though I'm perfectly comfortable living a couple hundred yards outside it, and walking/driving through the plume area on a regular basis.  Embed Quote"

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I did my Masters in International Health which was public health with a focus on developing countries. I also did this in Australia, so I'm not sure how helpful my answer is going to be but I'll give it a shot for the A2A. I realised I wanted to do International Public Health after a brief stint volunteering in a community based cataract screening and surgery project in Orissa, India. I had previously completed a Bachelor Degree in Human Biology and was in a soul destroying job in a pharmaceutical company, the sole purpose of which was to fund my then expensive taste in clothing (I'm writing this in an man's second hand shirt) and weird obsession with fake nails (ew, gross I know) - things have changed. I went to India not because I had any particular interest in India (now I love it and a little piece of my soul will always reside there) but because I had a crappy day at work and a volunteer thing popped up on my screen and my 21st birthday was coming up and my parents said that I could go on a trip instead of having a party if I wanted. And I applied. I was blown away. First by just how awesome India was, my little slice of Orissa was like a little slice of heaven. But then about the health issues people were facing. What I took issue with though was not the clinical aspect. I wasn't say, super interested in being able to treat a specific child for a specific problem. As a cultural outsider who did not speak the language I really didn't see that as my role. But I was interested in issues of access and equity and resource distribution and epidemiology and initiatves that changed the health of entire communities, of prevention. Rather than returning to the bowels of the pharma industry I thought it better to get the skills I was going to need in my new area of passion. But I also needed experience. So I studied my Masters of International Health at Curtin University (which is in Western Australia) by distance while I worked at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) on a child health project overseen by the WHO. The Australian government pays for my education. They also paid me to work in Bangladesh for that year. Sweet deal huh? The organisation helped me to conduct my Masters dissertation research which was on the care-seeking behaviours of mothers in the first three days after their baby was born in an area where we were running a Village Health Worker project. I loved it. I worked for that organisation for another year, then moved to South Sudan where I worked on am HIV and Gender Based Violence Project for returning refugees. My Masters helped me get my foot in those doors but a key component was contacts. You really would struggle to get anywhere in development work without contacts and I had been getting progressively better at putting myself out there to make them (self-promotion is an uncomfortable thing for an Australian).l then decided that aside from the skills I got from the Masters I needed other skills. I felt strange telling people how things should be done without any knowledge of how one would do them on the ground. I decided to get my training in nursing and midwifery because of that (I did not have the time nor the patience for a med degree!). And as I suspected, reading an article on how to stop post-partum haemorrhage is significantly different from actually trying to stop someone from haemorrhaging.  The break to do this study wasn't all advantages though. I am only now re-enetering public health development work and am doing it at an entry level (HIV and Tuberculosis Public Health Officer in Botswana).  My only tip with a Masters degree is that it isn't about the degree. Reading a bunch of papers to write your own paper should not be the point and will get you no-where. You have to make connections. Which means you have to network. Which means that you attend every event/lecture/afternoon tea that has even the remotest connection to the field you are interested in. And then you go an ask people a whole bunch of questions and see if they need an RA. And you seek out volunteer work and internships. Make the degree work for you.  P.S. If you haven't already its time to develop an intellectual crush on Hans Rosling and Paul Farmer. Enjoy!  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I earned my MPH in 2001 from UC Berkeley. My background was as a biology undergraduate who had spent 3 years doing bench science molecular biology research. As much as this was a wonderful experience (at UCSF and University of Washington), I was interested in population level determinants of disease so pursued an MPH. An MPH by definition is quite broad in its requirements and emphasis, and it is incumbent on the individual to pursue their own nitch. That having been said, I think it is important not to delay pursuing an MPH because you are not sure of you own specific interest. I went in to an MPH with an interest in infectious diseases, and within the first year found a new focus in social determinants of health. My main point here is to not close yourself off to possible interests that you may not know about prior to enrollment - exposure to a variety of areas of practice and research is fundamental to most MPH programs.An advantage of doing an MPH is the flexibility to purse either an applied or research career based on the degree. In addition to switching from an interest in infectious disease to social determinants of health, I also switched from wanting an applied career in public health to being interested in research. If interested in research, of course, it is essential to pursue a doctorate following the MPH. The good news about PhDs in public health is there is much better funding and you generally don't have to take many loans.My concentration was Epidemiology/Biostatistics, which was great. It was essentially a focus on a methodological toolkit that could be applied to various problems. I generally am of the view that subject specific content can more easily be pursued on ones own, and the more technical content of epidemiology and biostatistics is more easily aquired in the formal academic setting (although of course this can be learned through self-study as well if you have the inclination). I wasn't that enthralled by calculus in undergrad, but applied statistics is a whole other thing - I became totally enthralled.The MPH is a big money maker for schools of public health, so there are few opportunities for funding. The best bet is to get a position as a research assistant that will pay for living expenses and depending on the institution, some coverage of tuition. I'm now an Assistant Professor and hire research assistants for 10-20 hour a week positions that pay about $15/hour but also cover a portion of tuition. You will put yourself in the best position for these positions if you have some programming experience in R or SAS or Stata, but there are a variety of positions that are available. Look for postings for positions at Schools of Public Health that you are interested in applying to, or contact Professors doing research in areas that you are interested in. In addition to helping to fund an MPH, working with a research group is invaluable in learning how Public Health research is done. For me, earning an MPH allowed me to have a switch in my career trajectory, and begin to acquire a statistical analytic toolkit, as well as understand theories of disease causation, which were invaluable to me being able to pursue work that was most aligned with my interests. The curriculum is somewhat of a remarkable balance of intellectual and practical application to improving health. If that suits you, you should pursue it. As I once overheard a physician say, if you really want to help people - don't become a physician - study public health.After getting my MPH, I ended up going on to get my doctorate in public health at Harvard, and am now an Assistant Professor at Stanford. So this is a fairly traditional very academic track. But my colleagues in my MPH program have done a number of diverse pursuits, and in almost all cases have found very fulfilling work, ranging from working at Indian Health Services, to medical school to research assistants to environmental advocates.  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I decided to get an MPH while I was serving in the Peace Corps as a community health volunteer in Peru. I had a bachelor of journalism with little (ok, no) background in science. But my skills in communication seemed to translate pretty well to health education, as I could quickly research topics I knew little about and then translate the information into something that was easy to understand. I spent two years working with community health workers and teen promoters on the prevention of HIV, diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, dengue, malaria... I loved it. So when I was getting ready to go back to the States, I looked at the different MPH programs around the country. Many are more research-based, but given my background, I wanted more of a practical focus. In the end I applied and went to Tulane University in New Orleans for their health education and communication program. About halfway through my studies, I discovered I had a strong interest in epidemiology (in a nutshell: the study of how diseases appear and move through populations). My advisor encouraged me to explore other departments, and I ended up taking about as many courses related to epidemiology as I did in health education. I was fascinated and found I was most comfortable when I worked with the two concentrations in combination. My experience was enriched a lot by being in New Orleans. It's a wonderful but in some ways still-struggling city, where many of the public health concerns I learned about in the classroom were right there in my neighborhood. Instead of a research thesis, we were required to complete 300 hours of practicum. I did mine at the New Orleans Health Department and also volunteered at a safety-net clinic. Being a part of the health community there not only complemented my studies, but also helped confirm that I was in the right field. So that's the good stuff. The financing was the hard part. My program was expensive, with very few opportunities for scholarships or grants. I and most of my friends financed our education with student loans. For me it was worth it. Even after graduating, I'm still fascinated by current  research and bore (or sometimes horrify) my husband and friends with health-related trivia. Studying public health made me healthier. More in tune with what's going on in our world and more knowledgable about how policy and environments can affect how healthy we are. But that's me. I'd be interested to see how my experience differed from others here on Quora.  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I received my MPH in 2006 with a concentration in environmental public health. I was teaching environmental science in high school at the time and my thought was that the degree would improve my teaching but would also give me additional opportunities outside of teaching and would give me the skill set I need to have a positive impact on the environment.I found that the degree on its own didn't have a lot of teeth; I read a lot of books and wrote a lot of papers but I didn't come out of the program with any tangible skill set. If I had focused on biostats it would have been a different story but the environmental concentration gave me the opportunity to do environmental compliance work.It turned out I hated that work; it's basically writing reports showing that your company isn't doing anything wrong. It's a lot of ""I"" dotting and ""T"" crossing.  Most of the jobs that I have seen for environmental related work tend to veer towards government/industrial environmental compliance - other environmental jobs seem to require a background in environmental engineering or industrial ecology.If I had complimented my MPH with another degree, like a masters in environmental engineering or law then maybe I could have had greater opportunities within the environmental field - I am currently looking into a data analytical program to compliment my knowledge with learning to use large data sets for urban sustainability.My caution for anyone interested in an MPH is simple; on its own it probably won't expand you into a ton of opportunities - use it to improve your quantitative skills or complement it with another degree to really stand out.  Embed Quote"

Public health is an incredibly vast field but in order to get an MPH one should do a little bit of studying in what interests you in public health.  Embed Quote"

Why did they need lime juice?By adding lime juice to the drinking water, the condition of scurvy, due to Vitamin C deficiency, was almost entirely eradicated. Prior to this discovery, the ships' crews often became ill, suffered permanent impairment, and even died from scurvy. Lime juice changed all of this.Knowledge of Vitamin C was centuries in the future. This finding was based on observation, and correlation, not scientific causation as we know it now. Yet a 100% correlation was quite adequate: A bit of citrus juice daily ~~> no more scurvy.Progress reversedDue to an odd confluence of factors, about 100 years after the initial discovery of the relationship, policy makers decided that citrus fruits were detrimental to sailors' health, and caused scurvy! Somehow, the loss of life due to scurvy had not been documented, or maybe forgotten? Limes, lemons, all citrus fruit were disallowed in any form on ocean going vessels. Potatoes and meat were said to be effective for scurvy. Scurvy returned, quickly. Scurvy prevalence was worse the second time around, as there were far fewer foodstuffs containing any Vitamin C in ships' larders, compared to 150 years earlier! In the earlier days, citrus was often taken on as food store even without the knowledge of its benefit in preventing scurvy.I am fetching some citations for this, then will enter it as an answer.  Embed Quote"

Described as the ""savior of mothers"", Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics. Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals and often fatal, with mortality at 10%–35%. Semmelweis proposed the practice of washing with chlorinated lime solutions in 1847 while working in Vienna General Hospital's First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of midwives' wards. He published a book of his findings in Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever.Despite various publications of results where hand-washing reduced mortality to below 1%, Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. Some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and Semmelweis could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for his findings. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory and Joseph Lister, acting on the French microbiologist's research, practiced and operated, using hygienic methods, with great success. In 1865, Semmelweis was committed to an asylum, where he died at age 47 after being beaten by the guards, only 14 days after he was committed.Source: Ignaz SemmelweisAllowing thalidomide to go on sale without adequate testing:Thalidomide was released into the market in 1957 in West Germany under the label of Contergan. Primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, thalidomide also claimed to cure “anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and tension"". Afterwards it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an over the counter drug in Germany around 1960, and could be bought without a prescription. Shortly after the drug was sold, in Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with malformation of the limbs (phocomelia). Merely 40% of these children survived.The statistic was given that “50 percent of the mothers with deformed children had taken thalidomide during the first trimester of pregnancy.” Throughout Europe, Australia, and the United States, 10,000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included: deformed eyes, hearts, alimentary, and urinary tracts, and blindness and deafness.Source: Thalidomide  Embed Quote"

What is almost indisputable is that the changes in public policy that were implemented during the 1980s were sweeping and marked a turning point in American domestic policy. Faced with increasing competition from overseas, American business found it necessary to alter the social contract. This would require a realignment of the political economy so as to weaken labor unions and the social safety net. In Reagan, the Right found a spokesman capable of aligning conservatives, centrists, and working class whites. With this coalition, Reagan was able to bring about a number of reactionary changes in public policy (Alford, 1988).-- http://www.sociology.org/content...Unlike his ""trickle down"" economic policies, this change actually did what it was intended to do as outlined above. It shifted the burden of community health from a social compact to the individual, increasing needless suffering among the poor while enhancing personal and corporate gain among the wealthy.  Embed Quote"

In that time, the disease can continue to spread.  Second, it assumes we aren't able to detect the epidemic in its early stages. Going back to our demonstrative anecdote, say we were able to detect the disease while it was still just in the area around New Delhi. Local health officials could alert clinics and hospitals to watch out for the disease and isolate those who were sick, and track down people who were potentially exposed and quarantine them to ensure that they aren't sick, but more importantly, won't continue to spread the disease. If an epidemic is caught in its infancy, public health officials can prevent the disease from spreading too far, too quickly, but it takes a good early detection system with international support to make that happen. We're definitely making improvements in this area. There are some programs out there working toward early detection for early response, such as Innovative Support To Emergencies Diseases and Disasters (INSTEDD) and HealthMap. But these programs are still young in their development.  Embed QuoteVia  Lisa Linnet."

For that example, the SARS epidemic of 2003 compared to the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 is very instructive.SARS was more infectious and deadly than the Spanish Flu.  SARS occurred in a much, much more globally interconnected world with infected people getting on jets and landing on the other side of the globe hours later.  Spanish Flu occurred in a world without passenger planes.SARS killed fewer than 1000 people world-wide (916).  The Spanish Flu killed as many at 50 million people.The SARS epidemic killed 0.000013% of the global human population.  The Spanish Flu killed 3% of the global human population.The SARS epidemic lasted seven months from beginning to end.  The Spanish Flu lasted two years.The SARS epidemic killed an extraordinary number of health care workers compared to the general populace.  The Spanish Flu was much more weighted to the general populace.In short, a vastly more deadly disease was contained in a much shorter time with a tiny percentage of the casualties through the amazing workings of our world-wide public health system.  The average person had virtually no chance of getting it.Our public health system world-wide is exceptional and under-appreciated. For something to overwhelm it as you suggest would be off-the-charts unlikely, so unlikely that I would be looking at War of the Worlds explanations before I believed it to be true.[1]In the above example, the World Health Organization (WHO) took or was granted coordinative control of outbreak management by the vast majority of jurisdictions for world-wide information dissemination.Each country had a national body which engaged directly with WHO and local efforts.  (There was tremendous back-and-forth on this in Canada, as the vast majority of cases were in downtown Toronto, so it was quite reasonable for Ontario's public health organization to have direct responsibility.)In general, health jurisdictions within each country established their own outbreak management teams.  For example, in British Columbia, this fell to the BC Center for Disease Control.Public and Acute Health Practitioners -- highly trained, highly credentialed, front-line experts -- were of course in the forefront of the effort, identifying cases and establishing protocols.There were several tactics used in the fight against SARS:Quarantine - individuals who were exposed but were not yet sick were separated from people who weren't exposed, usually in medical facilities but often in their homes [2]Isolation - individuals who were already ill were separated from those not already ill in medical facilities [2]Interventions - These ranged across the spectrum from the individual to the global.  The largest was WHO world-wide travel advisories. [3]  These travel advisories took billions out of the world's economy, around $1 billion from Toronto and Ontario alone.  The smallest were treatments which had been proven successful in reducing the severity of the illness and preventing death.Sequencing of the Virus - Determining the genetic heritage and markers of the disease allowed more effective testing, separating those with SARS from those expressing symptoms similar to SARS but not caused by it. l4]What could get past this highly evolved system of protection?So what are the characteristics of a disease that could successfully bypass the extraordinary system of communicable disease prevention and wipe out half the population of the earth?Much more infectious than SARS - Measles is 5-6 times as infectious as SARS, which typically only saw three people infected by each infected person. [5]  A higher rate of infection would spread the disease much more widely much more quickly.Similar vectors but longer lasting than SARS - SARS was spread dominantly by airborne vectors through sneezing, but the virus also lingered on surfaces and there were many cases that occurred due to contact with a surface containing the virus. SARS can last for hours on surfaces and days in human waste. [7] If that were days and weeks, many more people would be infected by every surface that any SARS suffered sneezed upon, and likely a billion could have been infected by human waste in parts of the world with poor sanitation.Much longer incubation period than SARS with infectiousness - SARS had an incubation period of 10 days, meaning that less than two weeks after exposure a person would be exhibiting full-blown symptoms.[6]  A longer incubation period would allow infected people to transmit the disease much more broadly before being isolated. Notably, one group of SARS patients had a much longer incubation period.[6]Much less severe initial symptoms than SARS - SARS was very debilitating quickly, and typically patients died after weeks of illness. A slower onset of symptoms would allow the infected to avoid isolation for much longer and infect many more people.[6]Much higher eventual lethality than SARS - SARS had an overall fatality rate of 14-15% of those infected, skewing heavily to the very old, the very young and the previously ill. [6]  To kill 50% of the human population despite attempts to treat the illness, untreated lethality would have to approach 100%.Same starting point as SARS - SARS originated in China. A disease with the characteristics above could spread worldwide through manufactured goods [8]Greater resistance to heat and disinfectants than SARS - Common disinfectants and temperatures of only 56 degrees Celsius will degrade the SARS virus to the point where it cannot infect others.[9] Higher resistance to both heat and common disinfectants would prevent sterilization.A disease with the above characteristics would spread much more rapidly and include consumer goods and produce from China as a key vector of the spread of disease in addition to infected individuals. This would rapidly spread to other manufacturing centres.  It is possible that a disease with the above characteristics could cause a global pandemic that wipes out half the world's population, overcoming all of the extraordinary public health and communicable disease surveillance measures the world and countries have in place.  But it's still unlikely.References:[1] Mike Barnard's answer to Pandemics: If society started collapsing due to a global pandemic killing more than half of the world's population within a year or two, what would you do when you realized what was really happening?[2] http://www.marc.org/emergency/pd...[3] http://www.who.int/mediacentre/n...[4] http://news.nationalgeographic.c...[5] http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news...[6] http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchi...[7] http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-...[8] http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article...[9] http://enhs.umn.edu/current/5103...  Embed Quote"

Why? Because the history books are full of great restaurants who didn't get diners sick but were ""very sorry"", a statement that can and will be used against the restaurant in a court of law. Anything that can even remotely be construed as an admission of feeling guilty can cost potentially millions. Most lawyers smile when I say that, some claim they could get me off that rap, and the father of all food borne illness lawsuits, William Marler (Food Poisoning Lawyers and Attorneys) gets a little dribble of saliva whenever he hears it - it's a ""won case"" to quote him.So let's rewind...""This is Parry Hotter, I ate at your place last night and now I am so sick I can barely walk""""We are not aware of any other cases at this point, Mr. Hotter, were there other members of your party who also are now suffering from symptoms that could be food related?""""No""InterludeBy now, let's hope he used his credit card, we know which table and what was served. We can see what overlapped and what didn't. That's what cover reports and reservation computers are for.""I see here your party had the cod, the steak, and two pork chops. Which meal did you have, Mr. Hotter?""""I had the Cod. Listen, I don't want to do this, I am sick and I have to hit the head soon, I just want to...""""Mr. Hotter, we'll do anything in our power to find if there is anything wrong with our food. We have no had any other complaints and if we could just take a second and narrow this down, I'd be forever in your debt.""Interlude and MoreIf no one else got sick we're more or less done here. From now on out it's just making the diner feel good. We need to take his phone number, address, and name, because if another call comes in then we do have a problem, need to contact Mr. Hotter again, and make him whole.The respondent now calls the chef. If that's me, I'll drive in, secure all ingredients with potential contamination, and wait if there are more reports. If that's the case I'll contact the CDC, which I am obligated to do by law, the purveyor, and will call all affected diners to reimburse them, offer them assistance and a meal on the house if they feel like coming back.From here my effective and responsible reaction is to work hard to contain, inform, and cooperate. The CDC and the state health dept. work with me to make sure MY kitchen is clean, the former is not a law enforcement or regulatory agency so they're taking notes and advise, the State Health people are the ones with the law in their hands.My contact to the diner ends at this point. I have to be careful if there is no actual illness and I am prohibited from contacting them if there is until an official investigation is underway. Talking to diners could be construed as witness tampering if there's a state's case against me or my purveyors.All in all we're in a bind here. We get accused and sued for food borne issues quite a bit, extremely rarely with merit. So we have to be careful what we say and how we say it. If there is merit we're even less likely to be able to contact the diner. We try to be as forthcoming and supportive as possible, however, wherever that is not a bad idea.  Embed Quote"

In all likelihood it isn't that restaurant that caused the illness as most people are feeling ill right after the meal. Although possible 8-24 hours is more likely. The Health Department will try and determine what other foods have been consumed in the past three days and if other complaints have been received. This approach does two things. Lets the customer know they are serious about food safety and secondly weeds out those just trying to get a free meal.   Embed Quote

Prohibition harms civil liberties and encourages racial profiling. Prohibition impedes the use of drugs as medicine.  Prohibition breeds violence, corruption, and insurrection in supplier countries.  Prohibition creates disrespect for the law.Thus legalization will work in the sense that it will eliminate all these negatives of prohibition, with the only possible cost being a modest increase in drug use.  And even that effect of legalization is a benefit, not a cost, to the extent that drug users can and do use drugs without causing harm to themselves or others.  Embed Quote"

Not having a law against something isn't a policy experiment, it's the default position. The proper way to ask this question is: how has drug prohibition worked?With over 100 years of data to look at, the answer is quite obviously: drug prohibition has been a complete disaster.Fighting the drug war at home and abroad costs vast sums of money. A huge percentage of our citizens are incarcerated because of drugs. The drug war has ravaged inner cities, warped our foreign policy, and helped prop up violent regimes all over the world.Meanwhile, it has been mostly ineffective in its only conceivable objective: eliminating the harmful effects of drug abuse. It's impossible to know just how many more people would be on drugs if they were legal, but we do know that despite our best and worst efforts, lots of people still use them, in many cases causing a great deal of harm.Drug prohibition, then, is an extremely expensive government program with vast and wide-ranging harmful side-effects that has largely failed to accomplish its objective. It doesn't make much sense to ask whether getting rid of that policy would 'work', but it would almost certainly make the world a better place.  Embed Quote"

But many of the studies proponents have used over the years are problematic in that they did not account for other possible factors like income, diet, hygiene, etc. The Newburgh study, which really launched the whole fluoridation movement, has been  discredited to a large degree by Paul Connet's (et al) recent publication, The Case Against Fluoride (http://www.amazon.com/Case-Again...). No clinical scientific studies have ever been done to reach beyond correlation to some level of proof.Further eroding any certainty about the ""healthy goodness"" of fluoride is the fact that most developed countries have rejected fluoridation of public water, and their dental health is none the worse for it -- in fact it is frequently better than the U.S.So the claim of efficacy is shaky. However, there are many sources of fluoride besides tap water, so it's pretty difficult for anybody studying a population to have a truly clean control group to compare to a fluoridated population.As to potential harm, there is a wealth of information linking fluoride to all kinds of ills (http://www.fluoridealert.org/f-s...). I don't think anybody disputes that extreme doses cause skeletal fluorosis. And there are many signals that this is not altogether benign in its effects on the human body; for example, the recent moves (January 2011) by federal agencies to reduce exposure by lowering the maximum concentrations in water supplies (FDA), and phasing out the use of sulfuryl fluoride as a pesticide--both out of concern of over-exposure to fluoride compounds.Finally, perhaps the most important question that's not asked here regards the morality of mass medicating the population without informed consent, and without a reasonable non-fluoridated option.I lay this all out in a recent post on my blog: http://lucidstreams.com/2011/02/...  Embed Quote"

Miller, Jr., MD http://www.lewrockwell.com/mille...On its 60th anniversary proponents still have not proved that the hypothesis fluoride [put in public water] prevents cavities and is perfectly safe is true. The first part of the hypothesis, at least, has biological plausibility. Fluoride prevents cavities by combining with calcium in dental enamel to form fluoroapetite, which increases the resistance of teeth to acid demineralization. And fluoride inactivates bacteria that damage teeth by interfering with their enzymes. But biological plausibility alone is not sufficient to prove efficacy. Epidemiological evidence is required to do that. A debate open to well-informed opponents of fluoridation, if the CDC and ADA ever agreed to hold one, would show that existing epidemiological evidence does not prove that fluoride prevents cavities.In evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews (meta-analyses) are considered to be the best, most ""scientific"" evidence. A systematic review of water fluoridation studies, published in the British Medical Journal in 2000, found, as the chair of the Advisory Group that commissioned the review puts it, ""The review did not show water fluoridation to be safe. The quality of the research was too poor to establish with confidence whether or not there are potentially important adverse effects in addition to the high levels of [dental] fluorosis."" He adds, ""The review team was surprised that in spite of the large number of studies carried out over several decades there is a dearth of reliable evidence with which to inform policy."" The case for fluoride does not stand up to careful evidence-based scrutiny.Evidence that ""fluoride [put in public water] does not prevent cavities and is not safe"" (the null hypothesis) is more convincing. If a court of law held a trial on fluoride's safety and efficacy, the anti-fluoridationists would win. The judgment in their favor would most likely be beyond a reasonable doubt, or at least on a more likely than not basis. In a courtroom the pro-fluoridationists would not be permitted to employ ad hominem attacks that focus on the character of the opposing witness instead of the evidence, and dogmatic assertions on the safety and efficacy of fluoride would be subject to cross examination.Proponents of fluoridation will not willingly admit they are wrong. As Tolstoy puts it, ""Most men can seldom accept even the simplest and most obvious truth if it would oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to colleagues, have proudly taught to others, and have woven thread by thread into the fabric of their lives.""See also http://www.fluoridealert.org/lim... byDr. Hardy Limeback, BSc, PhD, DDSAssociate Professor and Head, Preventive Dentistry University of Toronto  Embed Quote"

Nuclear energy is also a good supplier of energy of such plants.The most economic desalination plants operate now with electric driven processses and more specifically reverse osmosis.

(Preferably manganese green sand with aeration)  Third a water softener.  (Preferably a back washable cation resin using salt) Lastly a drinking water unit.  (Preferably a reverse osmosis unit) Many homes with under 2 ppm of iron do well with just a water softener.  Sometimes iron bacteria can be present in the water and that will cause staining as well.  Check the water closet in the back of toilets as this is a common place for bacteria to multiply.  Use iron out or rust out chemicals to get rid of staining.This is just a guide.  Always seek professional help with your water needs.  GL.  Embed Quote"

Have rainwater pass through a few sizes of wire mesh which are each to clean. Setting this up well with start you off with cleaner water.

Lantagne is an environmental engineer with more than 10 years of experience in water treatment. She has evaluated and implemented household water treat- ment options in more than 30 developing countries, first as a lecturer with the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and with her own consulting firm, and for the last three years with the CDC. Medical epidemiologists Dr. Quick and Dr. Mintz, who also work at the Center for Global Safe Water at Emory University, have been with the CDC for more than 15 years. Both were involved in the initial cholera epidemic investigations that led to the development of the Safe Water System, and have been evaluating and implementing the Safe Water System since 1995.I realize this is in the context of the developing world, so there may be better alternatives in the ""developed"" world.

Removing Debris2. Removing Suspended Organic Molecules3. Disinfection4. Removing other chemicals (optional, depends on region and regulations)Here is my best guess at a cheap option for each of the first 3 steps.1. Removing debris: usually done by a mesh screen. Afterwards settling tanks allow dense material (sludge) to settle and light material (scum) to rise and be skimmed off the top of the water. These can either be incinerated (cheap, polluting, can produce power), landfilled (kind of expensive), or used as feedstock for gasificiation (high capital costs, ""clean"" efficient power generation capabilities);2. Removing suspended organics: After the solids have been removed the WW goes to aeration basins where activated sludge breaks down suspended organic molecules. Areation is energy intensive.3. Disinfection is accomplished either through chlorination (medium-high maintenance, possibly dangerous) or UV (safe, high maintenance).4. Removing other chemicals such as ammonia tend to involve more areation basins, and can cost roughly equal to the original aeration.That being said, wastewater treatment is generally a pretty expensive, albeit important, enterprise. It requires a great amount of infrastructure, capital, and oganization. Depending on the actual implementation, costs for certain things (such as chlorination, landfilling, energy prices) can vary widely. At the same time there is a certain physically/technologically attainable minimum energy cost that is hard to get past.Brown and Caldwell newsletters are generally a good way of staying up-to-date on new technology and methods: http://www.bcwaternews.com/  Embed Quote"

Water fluoridation was first introduced in Grand Rapids, MI in 1945. Previous research by the National Institute of Health showed that mottled enamel is very resistive to carries, and that’s how they got the idea of adding fluoride to drinking water.It was the first city in the US (and the world) to have water fluoridation (You can read more here; The story of water fluoridation: http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/oralhea...).II. Water fluoridation reduces dental caries because fluoride has a cariostatic effect; by making the enamel more resistant to acids (locally, and systemically while teeth are being developed), and by interfering with the metabolism of the bacteria that release these acids.III. Three additives are used in the USA:Sodium fluorideSodium fluorosilicateFluorosilicic acidIV. Safety/cancer: It's been almost 66 years since fluoride was added to drinking water, and so far, there has been no substantial evidence that there is a link between water fluoridation and cancer. No study (as far as I know) showed any potential health risk for water fluoridation.Most of these studies were descriptive epidemiological studies, which can help in deciding whether there is a convincing association with cancer or not. Case controlled studies are required to find out if there is direct assoiciation.The Community Water Fluoridation has an excellent list of studies and books to read on this matter:United States Public Health Service Review of Fluoride: Benefits and Risks, 1991http://www.health.gov/environmen...There have been over 50 human epidemiology studies of the relationship between water fluoridation and cancer. Epidemiological studies of fluoride usually attempt to identify statistical associations between cancer rates and county- or city-wide patterns of water fluoridation. Expert panels which reviewed this international body of literature agree that there is no credible evidence of an association between either natural fluoride or adjusted fluoride in drinking water and human cancer (LARC, 1982; Knox, 1985). Interpretation of these studies is limited by the inability to measure individual fluoride exposures or to measure other individual predictors of cancer risk, such as smoking or occupational exposure.The NCI study identified no trends in cancer risk which could be attributed to the introduction of fluoride into drinking water. The study examined nationwide moronity data and incidence data from counties in Iowa and the Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area. There were no consistent differences in the trends in cancer mortality rates among males and females living in counties having initiated relative mortality rates from cancer, including cancer of the bones and joints, were similar after 20-35 years of fluoridation as they were in the years preceding fluoridation. In addition, there was no relationship between the introduction and duration of fluoridation and the patterns of cancer incidence rates, including those of the bone and joint, and the subset of osteosarcomas (Appendix E). For example, there were 91 observed cases of osteosarcoma in the fluoridated areas, when 93 cases were expected based on rates in non-fluoridated areas.Institute of Medicine Dietary Reference Guidelines, 1997 (very extensive information from page 288-313):http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?...Australian GovernmentAustralia's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) conducted a systematic review published in 2007, that considered recent evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of fluoride interventions, with an emphasis on widespread public health initiatives. The council found that:Community water fluoridation is beneficial for reducing dental caries (tooth decay).Water fluoridation at optimal levels does not affect the risk of bone fractures.There is no clear association between water fluoridation and overall cancer incidence or mortality.The reviewed studies do not suggest an increased risk of adverse health effects at optimal fluoridation levels.http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelin...University of YorkA systematic review of public water fluoridation* was released in 2000 by the National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, United Kingdom. Based on the best available research they found that:Community water fluoridation reduces tooth decay.Fluoridation is still effective even with the use of many other sources of fluoride.There is no clear association between fluoridation and bone fractures or cancer.There appearsto be no difference between benefits from natural and artificial fluoridation.There is an association between the water fluoride concentration and the occurrence of dental fluorosis.No clear evidence of other potential negative health effects were found.http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/f...My personal advice: if you have some worries about water fluoridation, then simply stop drinking it. Bottled water is usually fluoride free, and many water filtration systems help too. Besides, tap water usually has chlorine taste that I find very unpleasant. Nowadays, most toothpastes come with fluoride, and topical fluoride is very effective at reducing dental caries. If you follow a good dental hygiene program, then you don’t have to worry about having  dental caries because there is no fluoride in your drinking water. Don't forget that your food also contains fluoride.For further reading, I recommend the following:National Academy of Sciences on Fluoride in Drinking Waterhttp://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/...CDC: Community Water Fluoridationhttp://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/...  Embed QuoteThis answer is not a substitute for professional medical advic...

As stricter regulations are adopted, treating water will be increasingly expensive. The capital required to build these additional treatment processes may be too much for decentralized systems to handle efficiently, so it would be more cost effective to pump the water to the larger treatment plant. Because of this we would be likely to see more centralization. New technologies for water treatment are slow to be adopted because of the large costs and political risk involved, and are often only put into place when tightening regulations force the agency to change.EDIT: this is looking at it from the waste water side.

So as we use more wells, and better yet, rain water, we will seek better decentralized options for treatment prior to drinking. If it becomes more difficult to pipe waste water elsewhere. The real upside is contaminating less water. By switching to composting toilets and altering a few behaviors we could use less than half the water which makes processing much easier. People will likely learn more about the different kinds of water water and how each can be a resource instead of a burden. By switching to non-toxic soaps, you can feed your garden kitchen water, and laundry and shower water too. Composting toilets use no water at all!

However it is possible to treat waste water to a very high standard on a small scale. Problems arise where the maintainance, and skills required to maintain such things aren't available locally (within the household). Though if such things where to become more common, less people would expect anything that can be flushed, to just disappear. Realistically rainwater harvesting, and storage. As well as some grey water recycling,could vastly reduce the use of potable water, for such things as irrigation, and flushing WCs. Many householders should be able to maintain this sort of system. Failures might be inconvenient, but are less likely to be polluting.Edit:I had not thought of the fresh water side, that is more tricky. Short of collecting and boiling rainwater, this is more difficult. To extract, and treat water to potable standards, on a small scale, is possible. Here lack of maintainance, or failure could have serious health consequences. Not to mention the use of some possibly unfriendly (if used incorrectly) chemicals, some that could also be a bit bangy.

In most situations, it will be cheaper to build a large, centralized system. However, with better technology today, it is possibly to have more efficient small-scale systems. Smaller, decentralized systems also have cheaper build-outs. Because of this, they tend to work better in rural areas where people are more spread out. With that in mind, it would be less likely to build a decentralized water network in densely populated urban areas. I think that a decentralized network could have a smaller impact on the environment and, in some cases, a smaller cost. For these reasons, I see this as a highly intriguing question. I would like to see more research done on comparing large centralized networks with large decentralized networks. While centralized networks almost exclusively have to be managed centrally, a decentralized network could be managed by a single entity or by smaller, local management groups. It absolutely depends on the location, but I think that we will see more decentralized water management in the future.  Embed Quote"

There IS a technology that allows to ""filter"" salt water into drinking water, without evaporating (distilling) or freezing it - it works only by applying pressure. See ""reverse osmosis"" on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rev...).I haven't heard about this technology before, and learning about it is kind of like seeing an airplane fly after being told that nothing heavier than air can do it...

High-volume RO systems are expensive to install and the membranes themselves need constant maintenance and replacement after a decade or so. A tiny 1gal/min system to cost up US$10K and it only gets much more complex and expensive as you scale up. The process itself is very energy-intensive, almost 10 times the energy cost of non-membrane treatment (which is usually already provided by municipal treatment if the beverage company has a tap water hookup). Even with a well-water source, reverse osmosis is usually not competitive with alternatives like conventional filtration or disinfection.Additionally, the product beverage may call for water with a certain salt content that would have been lost during RO. Recall a certain brand of beer that says ""It's the water!""? Permeate coming directly off the reverse osmosis process actually tastes terrible and is quite corrosive (to pipes...and stomach lining!) because ultrapure water is ""hungry"" for salts. Salt solution or the original feed water are usually added back after RO to make the permeate drinkable.  Embed Quote"

While one may not consider the use of plants as a technology per se it is a process that has served us for millennia that we are only just beginning to understand and incorporate into our towns and cities. Professor of urban design and landscape architecture at MIT, Alan Berger researches restructuring of local ecosystems to perform ecological services. One example of a restoration project is a partnership between his company P-Rex (http://www.theprex.net/) and regional officials of Lazio in the provence of Lativa, Italy to use restored wetlands to clean up the Pontine Marshes. http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/20...Alan Berger - Systemic Design (c) Can Change the WorldThe conventional way of dealing with the problem would be to build water treatment plants that cover nearly 300 sq. miles. The solution proposed by Alan Berger would require just under one sq. mile of restored wetland using winding channels, slowing down the water speed to less than a mile an hour, to clean up the toxins in the Pontine Marshes. What's novel about these constructed wetlands as opposed to similar systems is that the end result is a beautiful landscape that can provide economic as well as ecological value to the surrounding area.To answer Aseem's question, the plants that are often used for water purification are Typhas and Phragmites (cattails and the common reed), which are invasive species. With a shift to promoting biodiversity, companies will use up to 200 species suited to all climate types and often include plants indigenous to the area. Other plants include Yellow Iris (Iris pseadacorus), Simplestem Bur-reed (Sparganium erectum), Water Soldier (Stratiotes aloides),  European Frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae), European White Waterlily (Nymphaea alba), and Eurasian Water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) are included. However there's more to it than selecting the right plants. You need to reconstruct and seed a healthy ecosystem which also includes selecting non-predatory fish and supporting bacteria. That way the system will hopefully be sustainable on it's own and more energy can be put into reducing the pollution in the first place.A slightly unrelated but very impressive project is the Sahara Forest Project. Led by Michael Pawlyn, Charlie Paton and Bill Watts, it uses biomimicry to generate fresh water and reverse desertification using greenhouse desalination techniques in combination with concentrated solar power.

The hypothesis runs that the more you manage people with things like pedestrian crossings, roadside fencing, elaborate signage etc., the more you disable them and disengage them from where they are and what they're doing.There's some evidence for this, particularly associated with Dutch experiments to eliminate the sidewalk/pavement distinction (pavement/road for British readers). This produces slower driving with fewer accidents. However, it's very expensive to do - unlike simply removing the bins! But the underlying thinking is the same. Make people responsible for themselves in space, and they start to behave in more complex, interactive ways.Retrofitting cities this way is fiendishly complex to do systematically, but it's quite cheap just to remove signage, clutter, furniture, waste bins. And it looks nicer. We don't know yet, however, what the effects of doing this piecemeal are - so doing it for three streets, while the remaining 2,000 stay as they were.  Embed Quote"

There are two approaches to this, eliminating dust at the source, and eliminating it at the intake. I'd start with stopping it at the source. Cutting and machining metals with a lubricating coolant will improve the quality of the work, make your tools last longer, and eliminate airborne dust. Do this first. For operations which must be done dry, arrange for dust collection. Be careful of fine aluminum powder. It can be hazardous! Finally, protect yourself with a dust mask.

Danger! Dust may form flammable or explosive mixture with air, especially when damp. Reacts violently and/or explosively with water, steam or moisture. May ignite or explode on contact with moist air. May cause eye and skin irritation. May cause respiratory tract irritation. Air sensitive.Target Organs: Lungs, eyes, skin.Potential Health Effects     Eye:          May cause eye irritation.      Skin:          May cause skin irritation. Low hazard for usual industrial handling.           No sensitizing effects known.      Ingestion:          May cause gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, vomiting and           diarrhea.      Inhalation:          May cause respiratory tract irritation.

If so, what can I do to protect myself? For example, irrigate my nose daily, wear a mask, or get the air more ventilated.","I work for a company that manufactures industrial air pollution control equipment, and I have received many inquiries concerning aluminium and other airborne dust. Although breathing aluminium dust is not advisable for health reasons, there are much greater dangers associated with sanding, cutting, grinding, deburring and finishing of aluminium parts. The most serious risk arises when aluminium and steel (or stainless steel parts) are worked on in the same area. Mixing aluminium and steel dust creates a potential for combustion (an explosion or a fire) when an ignition source (a spark) ignites the airborne or settled dust particles. To mitigate this risk, ferrous and non-ferrous metals should not be operated on in the same area and the different dusts should be collected using separate dust collectors or downdraft tables. An alternative way to capture combustible dusts such as Aluminium, Titanium, Magnesium etc. is to use a wet dust collector which safely captures combustible dust and complies with all NFPA and OSHA standards. To specifically answer your question, above all else, make sure that you are not breathing in any fumes from stainless steel welding. Although all welding fumes are toxic and cause health problems, fumes from welding on stainless steel produce Hexavalent Chromium, a known carcinogen which can cause lung cancer, immunity disorders, neurodegenerative disorders... Hexavalent chromium. Welders working on stainless steel must use a fume extractor with a HEPA filter to comply with OSHA standards.My suggestions relating to your question:Capture dust and smoke at source with the correct air filtration equipment If not feasible, ventilate the shop with ambient air cleaners/ exhaust systems Workers exposed to the aluminium dust should wear masks/ respirators  I have linked to some videos below on the hazards of combustible dust:Shameless plug :D  Embed Quote"

People need to learn the aesthetic pleasures of a trash free environment.And in addition to that, we kind of need to give ourselves a break. Storms do a lot of damage, and take things that were never meant to be trash and sweep them into places where they look ugly. But it's still a very small portion of the entire waste stream.We will recycle more and more of our waste as it becomes more economically viable. These things will happen. So I'm not that worried about trash disposal over the long term. There will come a time when we mine old waste disposal sites. People will compete to own them for the value of the trash.

Look at the campaigns against smoking. When cast as the worst health care crisis in the world, (which it probably is not) politicians and activists have been given a wedge to pry into the cracks of America's love of smoking. Every celebrity who dies of lung cancer is held up as a blood sacrifice taken by the evil cigarette companies. Characters like Joe Camel are demonized as sirens luring children to their doom. If ecologists want to reduce waste and reform America's waste system, they have a lot if work cut out for them. If they can frame their argument in a way that it emotionally hooks people, and stirs their pride, they will be a lot more successful. No one cares that trash kills Tawny Owls.

I hung out with some locals one week. If they had trash (for instance, an empty beverage container), they would carry it in their hands until they did find a public trash can, and then carefully place it in the appropriate recycling section (and all trash cans had separate bins depending on which type of material could be recycled from the trash at hand). If that section was full? They'd keep carrying it until they found one that wasn't, further down the road (or at home/work). (Tokyoites also take their recycling very seriously.)Heck, even when it comes to smoking, they're responsible. They carry portable ashtrays so they can smoke without ashing or leaving cigarette butts on the street. (These ashtrays can be securely sealed, so no worries about making a mess or any odors.)Contrast this with New York, where littering is common and trash bags are officially left on sidewalks. The finest sanitation department in the world and trash cans every three steps wouldn't help.  Embed Quote"

Essentially a hole in the ground, in developed nations environmental law requires them to be lined to prevent lequids entering water sources. However in poorer nations and older sites they may not be, which isn't a problem depending what rock they sit on. Waste is then dumped in the hole until full or until it's licence runs out then they are usually sealed. You can draw the gas off that is produced as the rubbish breaks down, you can then use this gas to produce electricity our just burn it. They don't smell as much as you'd think!Landfill sites vary in size, they can be big enough to be seen from space as in the fresh kills site in new jersey or they can be a few hundred metre squared. You have all manner of trucks bringing waste in with large compactors then to level the surface, this allows dumper trucks to since on the surface. Your bin at home will probably smell worse than a well managed landfill, because they're out in the open. Landfill sites in Europe are heavily legislated, and require sealing after they have been closed. This is done with a huge series of water tight rubber sheets which then get between five and ten metres of soil dumped on to to allow shrubs etc to grow.Big ones are managed the same as small ones, except more staff to compact and man the weighing station.

They are managed and operated meticulously, providing a safe and effective option for their community’swaste.Many incorporate state-of-the-art systems including: Bottom Liners — isolate and contain the waste from the surrounding environment.Leachate Collection Systems — removes any liquids that form in the bottom of the landfill.Gas Collection Systems — when bacteria in the landfill break down the trash, methane gas is produced as a byproduct of this process. Methane gas is highly flammable and can explode or burn, therefore it must be removed. This is done by embedding a series of pipes within the landfill, which allow the gas to be either vented or burned.The waste is managed each day by compacting it into layers and covering it with six inches of soil or an alternative daily cover to control odor andlitter. Once a landfill is full, as part of the environmental protectionprocess, a final cover is placed over the area. This cover generally consistsof several layers of clay or HDPE plastic, along with a final layer of topsoilthat is capable of supporting vegetative growth, leaving the area beautiful andnatural.To see a helpful landfill diagram, click here: http://www.advanceddisposal.com/...  Embed Quote"

Positive things I've noted include:Because recycling is cost effective (you can bring plastic or aluminum to a center and be paid by weight), recycling happens. It may happen before the trash gets to the dump, or after. In any case, the trash is sorted through and anything of value is removed and taken to centers.Other things of value are removed and used. Old tupperware becomes a pot for a plant. Discarded shoes are snagged and used until unusable. Waste to some is not waste to all. Etc.My suspicion, based only on empirical evidence, is that in rural, less economically developed areas there is a lot less waste in dumps.Unfortunately, due to ignorance about the negative effects of burning trash, a lot of waste is simply burned, including styrofoam and plastics. Rural dumps would see a lot more trash if people stopped burning it.  Embed QuoteAnswered in forty-three minutes via  Anonymous."

You can even get companies dedicated to Business Waste Collection & Waste Disposal & Recycling Management. There are also 'dumps' where waste that is too large or there is too much of it can be put which are away from residential areas and controlled by the local council.

Traditionally some shops produce waste that gets smelly and has to be cleared quickly, places like fishmongers, grocers, butchers and restaurants. The places are cleared before the sun comes up.One of the problems waste collectors have is removing stuff that isn't junk, so they like to work when no one is around, leaving things like kids bikes by bins.No work can be done before 7 a.m. because this contravenes noise nuisance regulations. In urban areas councils are paranoid about bird droppings which accumulate during the night.Roads can also be cleared of dead animals.Refuse collectors work to the same weekly or two weekly schedule, the idea being that you get the same crew and collection at the same time.If the bin collection really is a problem for you, try writing to the council, they are a public service. You can get your collection time changed or have special collections. They often arrange later collections for the elderly.The general idea is that the town is cleaned up before people are awake and start anew.One of the traditional perks of being a binmen is that you finish your round and then go home, although this isn't the perk it was in the seventies, most bin collection is put out to tender.You make some valid points. It wouldn't cost any more to make collections in the afternoon.  The service is run by your local council and the admin don't get that many complaints, they will probably listen to you.  Embed QuoteVia  David Bain."

E-waste contains various toxins and hazardous components like mercury, lead, cadmium etc, which need to be disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner. If handled improperly, they can lead to severe environmental pollution as well as cause serious health conditions. It is found that electronic waste accounts for 40 percent of the lead and 75 percent of the heavy metals found in landfills. Once old and unused electronics are thrown in a landfill, it leaches into the ground and contaminates soil and water, and eventually having adverse effects on the eco-system and human health, including permanent disabilities, asthma, psychological and neurological damages and even affect bone development. It also poses severe repercussions for those who lives in vicinity of the places where e-waste is dismantled, recycled or burnt.  Embed Quote"

But it isn't just as simple as putting a sticker on the product, you would need to fill in some pollution declaration forms, or if you're refurbishing or handling old/damaged equipment a 'waste transfer' notice.Any repairman would tell you they could scrap almost everything from old electronics, with the possibility of reuse.And chemicals contained by PCBs can slowly leak in time and potentially react to form other nasties in landfills.It is your responsibility to separate e-waste, as this statement from Cisco states: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/c...Not all electronic products can be made RoHS compliant. CRTs and Lithium batteries are inherently out of category, because they cannot be manufactured without some lead at least. In order for a product to comply, all of its subparts and manufacturing processes must comply. There are small exceptions. Exemptions can be made for integrated circuits that have a quartz clock source - very important because a lot of digital circuits tend to work with this.Mercury  is very uncommon today in household electronics, and is phased out even for  industrial use. it is present in minute quantities(ug) in CF lights, but if one such bulb is broken it is less of a hazard than breaking an old fashioned medical thermometer that contains concentrated liquid mercury.other  chemicals: hexafluoride, halides, halogens, etchants, acids and salts  (in batteries). Cadmium batteries have seen a decline, but sometimes CdS  is used as a semiconductor material in solar cells.In  recent times, plastics have began to be questioned for safety as well  as some cleaning chemicals used for PCBs/PWBs that are similar to BPA,  now a proven carcinogen. Since the casing for electronics is not  regulated in any way, some plastics may emit in time amounts of  plasticizers or bonders that may be toxic, especially under high  temperature (hair drier for instance).There are of course other examples.Normally, these chemicals are not present in large enough quantities to cause a health concern, but a landfill may include a disproportionate amount of electronics that can change the problem. This also increases the likelihood of ground water contamination.  Embed Quote"

Primarily these landfills look for microbial decomposition to release methane.There is going to be a lot of fungus in a landfill -- mold spores and the like are unavoidable -- but I'm not aware of them being used deliberately to accelerate decomposition.

Firstly, fungi is used in decomposition of vegetable matter in industrial-scale composting. Fungi decompose cellulose and gradually lignin, components of tree and leaf matter. Oxygen is required for this type of composting. There are other microbes at work as well. In anaerobic composting, bacteria work on a wet slurry to make methane from animal and plant wastes, a different process. In vermicomposting, red worms are used to speed up the decomposition of vegetable matter, they keep conditions ripe for fungi and bacteria by oxygenating and allowing the substrate to hold moisture better than traditional composting methods. There are some landfills that divert vegetable matter towards composting, but using fungi for decomposing styrofoam and more long-lasting wastes is at best in the realm of study currently.The second use of fungi in waste management is quite interesting and exotic. Paul Stamets (a rock star among mycologists), has demonstrated the ability of fungi to clean up unwanted industrial wastes. He has engineered oyster mushrooms to completely clean up land-based oil and diesel fuel spills in weeks as well as using another type of mushroom to attack and filter E. coli from farm runoff. In the first demonstration, some piles of toxic diesel fuel waste were made, many teams tried to clean up their pile. Some used specialized enzyme treatments, some used reactive chemicals, some sponge-like mechanisms, Stamets inoculated the pile with his mushroom, and three weeks later there were thousands of harvestable (edible) mushrooms living off the hydrocarbons. Some time later grass was growing in the pile. Meanwhile, the other piles remained toxic wastes. In the second demonstration, sand bags of innoculum were placed at the runoff sites of the farm, and downstream the rate of E. coli and other diseases was shown to be negligible after a few weeks. The fungus actually grabs on to these harmful bacteria and uses penicillin-like compounds to destroy them. (penicillin is a fungus). Fungus is truly remarkable.  Embed Quote"

Other pollutants from the waste itself are also released. To avoid these emissions WtE-plants continually monitor temperatures in the combustion chamber and also have filters and scrubbers to remove pollutants from the exhaust.The main reason that there are not more plants is their cost. WtE-plants are expensive and for them to be cost effective they usually need to be quite big. WtE plants also need to deliver their energy to consumers, and you will usually find them close to cities or areas where they can deliver energy in the form of heat, i.e. to district heating systems. Just delivering power in the form of electricity usually gives the plant low efficiency and building a WtE plant to do only this is usually not cost effective.Building a WtE plant is a large investment and a cheaper option is to just make a landfill for your waste.  Embed Quote"

There processes certainly have an element of danger, with incineration and super heated steam turbines there's certainly risk of injury - but not to their environment. A lot of post-processing of fumes occurs, where they are cooled filtered, there's a bit more info on the way they work here http://www.rabbitgroup.co.uk/env...Why there aren't more of them? Well that's a question of money I suspect. They cost quite a lot to build and maintain - so people aren't exactly queueing up to build them.

I had previously completed a Bachelor Degree in Human Biology and was in a soul destroying job in a pharmaceutical company, the sole purpose of which was to fund my then expensive taste in clothing (I'm writing this in an man's second hand shirt) and weird obsession with fake nails (ew, gross I know) - things have changed. I went to India not because I had any particular interest in India (now I love it and a little piece of my soul will always reside there) but because I had a crappy day at work and a volunteer thing popped up on my screen and my 21st birthday was coming up and my parents said that I could go on a trip instead of having a party if I wanted. And I applied. I was blown away. First by just how awesome India was, my little slice of Orissa was like a little slice of heaven. But then about the health issues people were facing. What I took issue with though was not the clinical aspect. I wasn't say, super interested in being able to treat a specific child for a specific problem. As a cultural outsider who did not speak the language I really didn't see that as my role. But I was interested in issues of access and equity and resource distribution and epidemiology and initiatves that changed the health of entire communities, of prevention. Rather than returning to the bowels of the pharma industry I thought it better to get the skills I was going to need in my new area of passion. But I also needed experience. So I studied my Masters of International Health at Curtin University (which is in Western Australia) by distance while I worked at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) on a child health project overseen by the WHO. The Australian government pays for my education. They also paid me to work in Bangladesh for that year. Sweet deal huh? The organisation helped me to conduct my Masters dissertation research which was on the care-seeking behaviours of mothers in the first three days after their baby was born in an area where we were running a Village Health Worker project. I loved it. I worked for that organisation for another year, then moved to South Sudan where I worked on am HIV and Gender Based Violence Project for returning refugees. My Masters helped me get my foot in those doors but a key component was contacts. You really would struggle to get anywhere in development work without contacts and I had been getting progressively better at putting myself out there to make them (self-promotion is an uncomfortable thing for an Australian).l then decided that aside from the skills I got from the Masters I needed other skills. I felt strange telling people how things should be done without any knowledge of how one would do them on the ground. I decided to get my training in nursing and midwifery because of that (I did not have the time nor the patience for a med degree!). And as I suspected, reading an article on how to stop post-partum haemorrhage is significantly different from actually trying to stop someone from haemorrhaging.  The break to do this study wasn't all advantages though. I am only now re-enetering public health development work and am doing it at an entry level (HIV and Tuberculosis Public Health Officer in Botswana).  My only tip with a Masters degree is that it isn't about the degree. Reading a bunch of papers to write your own paper should not be the point and will get you no-where. You have to make connections. Which means you have to network. Which means that you attend every event/lecture/afternoon tea that has even the remotest connection to the field you are interested in. And then you go an ask people a whole bunch of questions and see if they need an RA. And you seek out volunteer work and internships. Make the degree work for you.  P.S. If you haven't already its time to develop an intellectual crush on Hans Rosling and Paul Farmer. Enjoy!  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I earned my MPH in 2001 from UC Berkeley. My background was as a biology undergraduate who had spent 3 years doing bench science molecular biology research. As much as this was a wonderful experience (at UCSF and University of Washington), I was interested in population level determinants of disease so pursued an MPH. An MPH by definition is quite broad in its requirements and emphasis, and it is incumbent on the individual to pursue their own nitch. That having been said, I think it is important not to delay pursuing an MPH because you are not sure of you own specific interest. I went in to an MPH with an interest in infectious diseases, and within the first year found a new focus in social determinants of health. My main point here is to not close yourself off to possible interests that you may not know about prior to enrollment - exposure to a variety of areas of practice and research is fundamental to most MPH programs.An advantage of doing an MPH is the flexibility to purse either an applied or research career based on the degree. In addition to switching from an interest in infectious disease to social determinants of health, I also switched from wanting an applied career in public health to being interested in research. If interested in research, of course, it is essential to pursue a doctorate following the MPH. The good news about PhDs in public health is there is much better funding and you generally don't have to take many loans.My concentration was Epidemiology/Biostatistics, which was great. It was essentially a focus on a methodological toolkit that could be applied to various problems. I generally am of the view that subject specific content can more easily be pursued on ones own, and the more technical content of epidemiology and biostatistics is more easily aquired in the formal academic setting (although of course this can be learned through self-study as well if you have the inclination). I wasn't that enthralled by calculus in undergrad, but applied statistics is a whole other thing - I became totally enthralled.The MPH is a big money maker for schools of public health, so there are few opportunities for funding. The best bet is to get a position as a research assistant that will pay for living expenses and depending on the institution, some coverage of tuition. I'm now an Assistant Professor and hire research assistants for 10-20 hour a week positions that pay about $15/hour but also cover a portion of tuition. You will put yourself in the best position for these positions if you have some programming experience in R or SAS or Stata, but there are a variety of positions that are available. Look for postings for positions at Schools of Public Health that you are interested in applying to, or contact Professors doing research in areas that you are interested in. In addition to helping to fund an MPH, working with a research group is invaluable in learning how Public Health research is done. For me, earning an MPH allowed me to have a switch in my career trajectory, and begin to acquire a statistical analytic toolkit, as well as understand theories of disease causation, which were invaluable to me being able to pursue work that was most aligned with my interests. The curriculum is somewhat of a remarkable balance of intellectual and practical application to improving health. If that suits you, you should pursue it. As I once overheard a physician say, if you really want to help people - don't become a physician - study public health.After getting my MPH, I ended up going on to get my doctorate in public health at Harvard, and am now an Assistant Professor at Stanford. So this is a fairly traditional very academic track. But my colleagues in my MPH program have done a number of diverse pursuits, and in almost all cases have found very fulfilling work, ranging from working at Indian Health Services, to medical school to research assistants to environmental advocates.  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I decided to get an MPH while I was serving in the Peace Corps as a community health volunteer in Peru. I had a bachelor of journalism with little (ok, no) background in science. But my skills in communication seemed to translate pretty well to health education, as I could quickly research topics I knew little about and then translate the information into something that was easy to understand. I spent two years working with community health workers and teen promoters on the prevention of HIV, diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, dengue, malaria... I loved it. So when I was getting ready to go back to the States, I looked at the different MPH programs around the country. Many are more research-based, but given my background, I wanted more of a practical focus. In the end I applied and went to Tulane University in New Orleans for their health education and communication program. About halfway through my studies, I discovered I had a strong interest in epidemiology (in a nutshell: the study of how diseases appear and move through populations). My advisor encouraged me to explore other departments, and I ended up taking about as many courses related to epidemiology as I did in health education. I was fascinated and found I was most comfortable when I worked with the two concentrations in combination. My experience was enriched a lot by being in New Orleans. It's a wonderful but in some ways still-struggling city, where many of the public health concerns I learned about in the classroom were right there in my neighborhood. Instead of a research thesis, we were required to complete 300 hours of practicum. I did mine at the New Orleans Health Department and also volunteered at a safety-net clinic. Being a part of the health community there not only complemented my studies, but also helped confirm that I was in the right field. So that's the good stuff. The financing was the hard part. My program was expensive, with very few opportunities for scholarships or grants. I and most of my friends financed our education with student loans. For me it was worth it. Even after graduating, I'm still fascinated by current  research and bore (or sometimes horrify) my husband and friends with health-related trivia. Studying public health made me healthier. More in tune with what's going on in our world and more knowledgable about how policy and environments can affect how healthy we are. But that's me. I'd be interested to see how my experience differed from others here on Quora.  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I received my MPH in 2006 with a concentration in environmental public health. I was teaching environmental science in high school at the time and my thought was that the degree would improve my teaching but would also give me additional opportunities outside of teaching and would give me the skill set I need to have a positive impact on the environment.I found that the degree on its own didn't have a lot of teeth; I read a lot of books and wrote a lot of papers but I didn't come out of the program with any tangible skill set. If I had focused on biostats it would have been a different story but the environmental concentration gave me the opportunity to do environmental compliance work.It turned out I hated that work; it's basically writing reports showing that your company isn't doing anything wrong. It's a lot of ""I"" dotting and ""T"" crossing.  Most of the jobs that I have seen for environmental related work tend to veer towards government/industrial environmental compliance - other environmental jobs seem to require a background in environmental engineering or industrial ecology.If I had complimented my MPH with another degree, like a masters in environmental engineering or law then maybe I could have had greater opportunities within the environmental field - I am currently looking into a data analytical program to compliment my knowledge with learning to use large data sets for urban sustainability.My caution for anyone interested in an MPH is simple; on its own it probably won't expand you into a ton of opportunities - use it to improve your quantitative skills or complement it with another degree to really stand out.  Embed Quote"

If you are not massively allergic to soy, the vast majority of GM foods are as healthy as any other food.  The hysteria about health is vastly overblown.  (If you are allergic to soy, consider the paleo diet.)Regarding Monsanto as a major agribusiness corporation, you can certainly choose to boycott them.  However, they will at best provide the seeds for a fraction of Whole Food's fruits, vegetables and grains.  Why would you boycott Whole Foods over that?  Just pick from the vast majority of foods that they will have that are not touched by Monsanto.  Embed Quote"

The seed Monsanto sells is not sterile. The seed we sell is either hybrid or varieties, all that seed produces viable seed. The seed from hybrids is not self replicating though so while it produces viable seed, the lack of uniformity makes it undesirable to save for subsequent seasons. Hybridization has been used for decades before biotech was on the market for the increased vigor it offers. With our biotech products, farmers sign a licensing agreement not to replant. You can read a farmers' thoughts on that here http://thefarmerslife.com/biotec... One of the things the blog post above does so well is to explain how farmers analyze the potential seed sources and choose whether to purchase seed annually or to buy seed which allows them to save the seed produced.

This leads to allergic reactions, some of which can actually be life threatening. So make sure that you consume these foods with care and consult your doctor. This is major problem since the safety of GMO foods have not been tested on humans, the researches were conducted on animals and the products were sold in the market.Cancer ThreatExperts are concerned of the connection between the consumption of GMO foods and an increased cancer risk; studies find that genetically engineered material can increase the occurrence of tumors. This greatly increases the risk of developing cancer.Super Pests!This is no joke! The genes used to make the crops resistant to pesticides can be transferred on to pests that feed on them.

(This is mostly tied to their ""Round-up Ready"" products.)They have a VERY litigious track record around patent enforcement claims. They've been known to sue (or merely threaten to sue) farmers who are adjacent to other farms that have used Monsanto products and seeds on the grounds that the adjacent farms may be infringing on Monsanto's patents. Referring back to point #1, if a farmer uses Monsanto products and then tries to plant non-Monsanto in following seasons, attorneys will again show up demanding evidence that the fields are completely free of patented Monsanto seeds.A number of well-publicized documentary films have covered the practices of the corporation.

The US will then buy corn from other sources, of course. There won't be enough, since we wiped out the Mexican corn industry with NAFTA, but we'll buy all we can. And we'll buy other grains in great quantities to make up for the short fall. As will other countries. Africa and the poor countries in Asia and Latin America will be shit out of luck, because prices will be too high for them to compete. Poor Americans, who live on diets comprised largely of cheap packaged foods made possible by high fructose corn syrup will also be SOL. Of course, Monsanto can produce a GMO seed that is resistant to the new fungus. So we're really only looking at how many people will starve to death in about 8 months. And we're only looking at it happening once every 10 or 20 years or so.  Embed Quote"

First lets start with the main thing Monsanto has been doing wrong in their business operations before I refute the nonsense surrounding RR crops and other GM crops. The one bad thing about Monsanto is that they are extremely paranoid about their patents. This causes them to sue in every situation they spot patent infringement, including individual farmers that intentionally, or unintentionally misuse Monsanto products. There is a good reason for this, but to me the patent infringement by independent farmers is negligible, Monsanto is simply worried that if they let the small cases of patent infringement grow, they won't be able to make the case if a hypothetical future has farmers simply replanting elevator seed and profiting off of past Monsanto traits and their hybrids. The cost of developing GM traits is extremely expensive, protecting this investment is a #1 priority at every level of business operations. Unfortunately they have chose to treat small farmers like they would a rival corporation. As a business manager, I would limit farmers' patent infringement in a different way, one that doesn't require litigation, but I can't say what Monsanto is doing is unethical or immoral, because, as almost every case of patent infringement brought by Monsanto, has seen the courts rule in their favor. (Remember that when a farmer takes seeds he produced from Monsanto seeds and plants them the next year without consent from Monsanto, he/she is knowingly participating in illegal activities. Farmers know this not only because of Monsanto, but because that is the way all seed companies are able to protect their intellectual property. Farmers rarely use this planting practice not only because it is illegal, but also because it is largely unprofitable). But hey, Monsanto recently took a $1 billion settlement from a 'bigger and badder' ag-business giant, Du-Pont, because the latter had willingly infringed on the former's patents that it had licensed. In that case, the little guy (Monsanto is 1/3 the size of Du Pont) defeated the wrong-doer. Now, lets really discuss GM products, and the one trait that gets the most criticism, Roundup Ready (RR). In order to produce the amount of yields U.S. farmers have seen in the past few decades, a revolution in farming has happened at many different levels. One of these was the introduction of glyphosate-resistent seeds. Glyphosate was less chemically-harmful than other pre-RR herbicides, leading to its wide-adoption by farmers once Monsanto had developed the RR-resistant seeds. Simply put RR seeds have been directly responsible for the decline in harmful chemicals that were being put into our soils by pre-glyphosate herbicides. Furthermore, and in my opinion, much more significantly, other types of GM seeds work to limit the pests that ruin crops (such as rootworm/corn borer, etc), this has lead to the widespread decline of pesticides used by crop-farmers in the U.S. Genetically modified foods are replacing the previously huge need for pesticides and herbicides, boosting yields, and making modern major-crop agriculture more environmentally sustainable than it ever has been before. Although anti-GM advocates may have valid concerns about some effects of GM products, this technology is revolutionary and is one of the main reasons countries like India and China are not suffering from widespread famine, as well as being one of the main reasons the world's poorest are receiving more calories and nutrients per person than ever before. Outside of their role in limiting the amount of pesticides and herbicides needed on a field, GM products have: Decreased the arable area needed to produce a certain yieldDecreased the amount of irrigation needed to produce a certain yieldDecreased the amount of fertilizer needed to produce a certain yield. The GM revolution was the needed appendix to the Green Revolution in world-wide agriculture production that occurred between the 1950s-1980s. GM products have increasingly helped to limit the amount of chemicals and needed natural resources (water for example) that are required to grow a certain amount of food. The Green Revolution is credited with saving billions of people from starvation. While this also produced some limited but unwanted effects of environmental degradation and pollution, GM technology brings the promise of a near-future that sees widespread major crop production become perpetually environmentally sustainable. Like any technology, GM technology does not always produce the desired outcomes (i would mention some, but too many overblown and less-than-significant examples have been produced in the above replies), but its failures are dwarfed by its accomplishments. Remember that.  Embed Quote"

Over 50 ears to get the same amount of magnesium as one ear of organic corn.  Etc.  You might as well be serving your family a tennis ball or some sawdust bread.   This gives a whole new meaning to “corn fed farmer”.    Is this where we want to go as a nation?  We have chosen to allow a corporation to monopolize our nutrition for profit.  We have granted them the legal right to attack strains of plant life that have sustained us for thousands of years.   Our health as individuals and a society is at risk.  Embed Quote

I am feeling much better staying away from anything agriculture tainted like wheat, soy, milk, and processed things. If your Doc cannot figure out what is making you ""feel real bad"" start eliminating things from your food and you will feel so much better. Those people that pointed out that Monsanto is using us as guinea pigs are so right on. Please call your representatives and senators and tell them to stop placing chemicals in our food supply and to give our farmers the rights to use their seeds like they used to. If this is not sorted out soon - we are in for a huge, huge health care issue.....we actually already are....... it is so sad.People in Europe eat much fresher and healthier food than in the good old USA.

To ensure that only high quality plasmids get transformed into plants, a number of requirements had to be met for the finishing software used by the Monsanto researchers. Other than the finishing tools, Monsanto’s also decided to make CLC bio the ‘one-stop shop’ for bioinformatics tools across their entire organization.

claims have said that it will increase packaging prices slightly. That's not a reasonable or justifiable excuse. People have a right to know what they are putting into their bodies, regardless of whether or not the producers claim it to be safe.It would be great to have a Monsanto employee answer this one, even if they must do so anonymously. Do you have any ethical qualms about the company you work for?","You are the reason Monsanto opposes labeling.If there weren't people running around implying to everyone that eating genetically modified organisms might be dangerous, then Monsanto wouldn't especially care whether its products were labeled that way or not.  It would just be one more bit of fine print that almost nobody reads.But because of people like you, Monsanto correctly assumes that if they were forced to label products, some consumers would try to avoid them.  Consumers would interpret a legal requirement to label GMOs as a government endorsement of the idea that eating GMOs might be dangerous or unhealthy.  And that would hurt Monsanto's profits, which is a good reason for a business to oppose something.As it happens, Monsanto is also correct regarding the safety of genetically modified organisms.  ""Genetically modified organism"" isn't a meaningful category of food.  One modification has nothing to do with another modification.  It's theoretically possible for a genetic modification to result in new proteins that cause negative health effects, but then again natural food can be unhealthy or dangerous too.  News flash: castor beans are 100% all natural, and if you eat a hearty meal of them, you will die in agony regardless of whether those beans were grown organically on a local farm by a smiling, socially-conscious farmer.  Genetically modified castor beans might be safe to eat though, if the genes could be altered to prevent the plant from producing ricin.Natural and safe simply have nothing to do with each other. This is why food safety testing exists; genetically modified or not, people check to make sure our food is safe.   Here's a short paper on how this applies to GMOs, from that noted reactionary institution, the University of California: Page on Ucdavis.  Embed Quote"

Labeling only adds value when the benefits to informed people outweigh the number of poor decisions made by uninformed people. That threshold hasn't been shown to exist for GMO food. People have wide misunderstandings about the safety and prevalence of GMO foods, and requiring labeling of something with no peer-reviewed evidence of harm to humans is a waste of resources, label space, and mind-space. The very real danger is that consumers will pay less attention to things that clearly matter, like calorie intake, and more attention to poorly-substantiated claims of harm by activist groups.  Embed Quote"

To label a food as GMO is to allow the mischief of misinformation and disinformation to affect their profits. This is something they are not keen to do -- and would likely be sued by their shareholders if they allowed their profits to drop when they might have taken action to mitigate the loss.Given the tenor of the question and its assumptions, Monsanto may have made the right decision.  Embed QuoteAnswered in forty minutes."

Do you have any ethical qualms about the company you work for?","I'm going to chime in here on this one, on a personal level.First and foremost, the laughable thing here is not Monsanto employees, but the utterly ill-informed people that think they are somehow entitled to say things like Monsanto employees have sold their souls... whatever that means. That is what is laughable.   My wife works at Monsanto.  She's not the devil incarnate, nor one of his minions.  She is not a careless scientist who thinks nothing of what she is doing and how it affects the world.  The fact is, people don't understand Monsanto.  They think they do because of subjective websites they've visited or subjective documentaries they've seen.  I won't debate what they do or don't do because I don't have the direct knowledge to do so.  But I will say this:  Monsanto employees listen to what is being said about them.  They hear the various information and apparent scientific evidence that is used against them.  And they shake their heads knowing that such information is taken out of context and spun, spun, spun for whatever objective the parties that be would like to ""accomplish"".  Heck, even Monsanto's biggest critic, who basically started the anti-Monsanto movement, has publicly apologized and recanted everything he ever said about them.  Why?  Because he actually learned the truth about their practices.  His name is Mark Lynas.   Time to call out the anti-GMO conspiracy theory Honestly, I listen to the critics of my wife's very own program and listen to her shake her head and pinpoint and elaborate on the little snippets of science and information taken completely out of context.  It's frustrating.  For me as her husband, to see such elitists, like the person who wrote this question obviously, to look down on someone that is actually doing some great things for this world.Monsanto doesn't cater to such elitists because it is utterly futile.  They likely don't want to label their foods with some GMO logo, that many uneducated people might see as some warning, because it would be them saying that their products are dangerous and deserve such a warning, which just isn't true.  I wonder if critics rely on medicine, which is chemically engineered by human scientists? I wonder if they consume foods that aren't sprayed by various protective substances created by human scientists?   These are moot points to the critics, though because in the end, it doesn't matter to them.It's laughable.  I don't know how critics, like the person who wrote this loaded question, can look themselves in the mirror and judge anyone like that.  If you want to ask a question, ask a question.  Don't taint it, or Quora, with your close-minded comments and judgement on a subject you clearly know nothing about beyond what you've read on the internet or seen on some subjective documentary.  Embed Quote"

If you want to take issue with some of Monsanto's reported business practices related to seed modification, I'm with you. The fact of GMOs, though, is a bit of a distraction that takes focus from far bigger challenges to the food supply, food safety, health, and nutrition.With that said, there is nothing whatsoever stopping individual consumers from demanding insight, voluntary consortiums offering non-GMO certification, and businesses participating – just as with movements like organic, fair trade, and countless other initiatives.

Do you have any ethical qualms about the company you work for?","Because they would have to label just about everything in the store. 85% of the food in the US is basically corn and soy. Aside from organic and free range alternatives, all the chicken, beef, and pork in this country is fed genetically modified corn and soy. All the farm raised fish, too. Everything that contains high fructose corn syrup is GMO. Monsanto corn is engineered for two purposes - resistance to pesticides, and high starch content to make it more suitable for producing HFCS. And we all know how pervasive HFCS is in American processed foods. Ironically, corn wouldn't have to be labeled, because we don't eat GMO corn in kernel form. It's basically inedible because of the super high starch content. Corn eaten whole in the US comes from Argentinian seed stock (which we sold them decades ago and they now sell back to us). I'm not sure what GMO soy is being used for, or what it's engineered for other than pesticide resistance. Soy has always been a manufacturing material in the US - Ford used soy based paint and plastics for years, and was the largest soy farmer in the Western hemisphere for a long time - so it may be geared towards that. Or it may just be Roundup resistant. We do know that US soy is linked to breast cancer, while Asian soy seems to prevent breast cancer. But that could be the fact that US soy products tend to be highly processed, while Asians eat it in more natural form. As for Monsanto employees, that's a loaded assertion you're making. And it misses the point. Arguments about the health risks and benefits of GMO foods are loaded with emotion, and can be seen from different perspectives. The real danger Monsanto, and the company's legal strategy regarding their intellectual property, presents has nothing to do with the food on our shelves. Monsanto has created monocultures for corn and soy, basically setting us back 5,000 years. If a disease that targets GMO corn shows up, we lose over 90% of our crop. That's the danger. It isn't the result of people selling their souls. It's the result of letting chemists and lawyers and bio-engineers take over the agriculture industry.  Embed Quote"

Do you have any ethical qualms about the company you work for?","A number of reasons:Labeling is expensive. The sheer number of different products that contain GMO (by any definition) is significant. It might actually be simpler to label the foods that don't contain GMO, which basically what we do now, though inconsistently.What's GMO and what isn't isn't well defined. For GMO labeling laws to be enforced would require giving some body broad discretion to decide what is and isn't genetically modified. This is both undemocratic and creates a lot of uncertainty for businesses, as well as the usual opportunities for rent seeking and regulatory capture.You might expect that if some information is good, more is better. Yet people don't always make better decisions when given additional information. When the additional information is irrelevant, as GMO status is, it almost certainly results in worse consumer choices.There's a very understandable fear that arbitrarily marking certain foods as GMO could stigmatize them and put them at a competitive disadvantage. After all, you don't put warnings on things that are safe, and the medium is the message.Identifying GMO foods can be, and is being, accomplished voluntarily through various apps, websites, non-profit, or by the supermarket in-house. There doesn't seem to be any compelling reason why it can only be done by government mandate.It sets a dangerous regulatory precedent, shifting the burden of labeling from what consumers need to know to what consumer might want to know. What's next, marking the political donations of the company that makes it? The number of food-miles it traveled? Perhaps you want to know if the company that processes it gives its employees same-sex marriage benefits. Any of this stuff might be interesting, but it'd be important to only a small segment of the population. The bottom line is that there's an infinite number of things we might want to know about our food and where it came from. Given the limited attention span of consumer and the limited room on labels, there's clearly diminishing margins of return, and you have to draw a line somewhere.Opposing GMO labeling isn't a big priority to Monsanto, after all. Millions might seem like a lot to you, but according to their annual financial report for 2012, last year Monsanto took in 13.5 billion dollars in revenue.  Embed Quote"

But a priory, people have unsupported beliefs. If the labels were neutral they would be beneficial. I care about the planet, so I eat GMO. You care about your own health more than the planet for that impractical 0.01% chance that GMO might cut your expected age by 2 days, so you eat organic. This would have been fine with me. If it were neutral.For now, I would like the labels to be detailed. I do not like the labels to be organic or GMO, but a detailed information. For an example, instead of saying organic, one must say.1. This food required 20% more land to produce, so caused more deforestation.2. The food did not use artificial pesticides, but used natural pesticides. It is not known whether natural pesticides are any safer.Instead of saying GMO, one could say:1. The plant was modified to produce 20% more vitamin A than naturally found.2. The plant was modified to be pest resistance which required 20% less use of pesticides.3. The plant was modified to require 20% less land area, therefore saved some trees and also helped keep the prices low.Rather than just listing food by organic or by GMO, it is better to just list the scientifically established facts. Personally, I have never seen any producer of organic food to write a single benefit of being organic, which tells me a lot.It is just sad that elitist people want to misguide the public. Personally, all the top science loving people I know, they prefer GMO over Organic. Labeling just GMO or Organic helps when common people are equally educated too.  Embed Quote"

What they spend on lobbying would barely pay for a single television ad campaign. To some extent, the company is right and its stance is understandable. As Ryan has noted, the general American population does not have a particularly high degree of scientific literacy. And of course, Monsanto funds lobbying efforts because the potential profits make it well worth its while. And of course, in the back of their minds, I think Monsanto knows that they might lose the argument if they put it to the people. Not just because Americans are not scientifically literate, but because while GMO foods have not been ""proven"" to be dangerous or harmful yet, neither is there much evidence to show they are completely safe in the long-term. Part of this is simply that GMO foods have not been available for a long period of time, relative to a human lifetime. Things that look safe now, might turn out not to be -- and Monsanto knows this. Rather than risk losing customers like me who might choose not to take the risk, Monsanto would rather make it virtually impossible for me to avoid GMO foods. I'm not saying that you should need to show without any doubt whatsoever that GMO foods are safe for long-term consumption before bringing to market. But personally, I think consumers have the right to know. And the argument that a labeling requirement damages the brand because it automatically implies there's something wrong with GMO foods? Well, we label most other ingredients -- salt, sugar, various oils, wheat, corn, etc. That doesn't seem to have hurt sales at all. So I think that argument is bull.  Embed Quote"

In spite of revisionist history efforts about how great DDT was, toxins like Roundup don't just go away after use. People are right to be skeptical.  Embed Quote"

If the Gates Foundation was partnering to do something specific with Monsanto like the Africa project, why were they not more forthcoming in promoting that point. In my research so far (which brought me here to Quora), there isn't any mention of why specifically the Gates Foundation invested in Monsanto. Recently, the Humane Society invested in fast food mogul CKE (Carl's Jr and Hardees) as a means to influence animal rights within CKE. It's an interesting strategy.

We publicly praise companies that are doing good work and try to persuade others to step up. Sometimes we make grants to for-profit companies to give them incentives to join the work.

Up until it was signed, he writes,“the USDA [US Department of Agriculture] oversaw and approved (or denied) the testing of genetically modified seeds, while the federal courts retained the authority to halt the testing or sale of these plants if it felt that public health was being jeopardized.

When the gene is drawn from a non-food species, you have absolutely no idea whether it's something humans can eat or not. It will be tested in animals, but you can't test what happens when it accumulates over decades of human consumption. Still, humans have eaten novel foods all through their existence, and it's not entirely unreasonable to test things and pronounce them safe-enough, IF those tests are conducted properly. And frankly, I have no reason to believe that they are being conducted properly.The big agribusinesses have demonstrated themselves to be a right bunch of dicks in this area. Most obviously despicable is the case where Monsanto sued Percy Schmeiser, whose carefully-bred strain of canola was contaminated with Monsanto's proprietary genes, via pollen from another farm. GMOs that were not tested on humans have leaked into the human food chain, despite promises to the contrary. They fight against labeling, so that customers can't choose for themselves. They use misleading marketing to encourage farmers to replace their strains with Monsanto's strains, which have more genes in them to ensure that the results are sterile, so farmers must pay Monsanto every year and have usually lost the original stocks if they don't want to go back to it (and may well find them contaminated if they have). Those ""terminator"" genes serve absolutely no food purpose; they are there solely to ensure Monsanto's products.There are still more concerns, like the fact that GMOs are always designed to be grown in vast monocultures. There are severe environmental concerns associated with that style of growing food; it may not be sustainable no matter how safe the GMOs themselves are. Genes are introduced to make plants resistant to herbicides, meaning that your food is being doused with poisons, and it's of small comfort to know that the plant is safe. And weed resistance to those herbicides is springing up faster than the ag businesses claimed it would, so now we've got an extra gene in the food with zero benefit.But mostly, it's the fact that Monsanto is a bunch of dicks. It is conceivable that GMOs, like other technologies, can be used judiciously and carefully to improve overall food production. But Monsanto has frequently not been either judicious or careful, and are placing short-term profits over the long-term interests of people who eat food. The technology in the abstract may be beneficial, but the implementation of it justifies people being extremely wary of it.These are not problems that face hybrid crops. Hybrid crops do not rely on massive investments up front, and therefore do not encourage short-term profit taking. The genes from hybrid crops can't introduce novel genes into separate gene pools any more than they already were. The companies that push GMOs have motives that make them potentially dangerous, and have not shown themselves to be responsible in proportion to the risk.  Embed QuoteAnswered in forty-one minutes."

Those ""terminator"" genes serve absolutely no food purpose; they are there solely to ensure Monsanto's products. Let's just analyse this passage from your argument, shall we?  Monsanto sued Percy Schmeiser because he was pirating seed.  Some of the Roundup Ready seed from a neighbour's farm had fallen into his field, and he found that when he sprayed his own crop with weedkiller it still grew the next year.  So he saved it and started growing his own Roundup Ready crop without paying royalties for several years.  Hardly a case of accidental contamination.  So Monsanto - quite rightly - took exception to this and sued him.  He lost in a court of law.  Monsanto have never sued any farmer whose crop was inadvertently pollenated by a GM variety, and have even offered to help to clean up after such an event.The 'terminator' technology you talk about has never been sold to anyone.  That's right:  it never made it out of a laboratory.  Yet this myth keeps on being uncritically absorbed and equally uncritically regurgitated.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Most hybrids don't produce viable seeds either and have to be bought year after year.If you're wondering why I'm writing this, I'm neither pro nor anti-GM:  each application has to be taken on its own merits.  What I am sick of is people disinterring the same old zombie arguments, and these people are almost exclusively anti-GM, and they seem to have little new, interesting or even truthful to offer as an argument.  If you're going to write drivel, make it original drivel, at least new if not very interesting, will you?  Embed Quote"

They have turned our corn and soy crops into near genetic monocultures. Over 90% of those crops are genetically identical. That's very bad news if a fungus or bacteria they are susceptible to comes along. They have made it basically impossible for farmers to save seeds. Traditionally, a farmer kept the seeds from the best plants of each harvest so hey could be planted the next spring. That's how crops became hardier, or gave higher yields year over year. It's also how new varieties were created. That can't happen any more. Farmers who save seeds will be sued by Monsanto - without fail - and they will either lose or go bankrupt winning. The options are to buy seed from Monsanto, or buy it from the Argentinians. Most buy from Monsanto, because industrial food manufacturers aside from Birdseye and Green Giant (and the like) have no interest in Argentinian corn, and because once your crop is cross pollenated by Monsanto crops they own your ass anyway. So the only way change will be introduced into the corn or soy crops is if Monsanto develops those changes in their labs. They have, for all intents and purposes, cornered two of the most important crops in the world. If they screw up, or even if they don't screw up but something bad happens anyway, we're looking at starvation on a massive scale throughout the Third World, because the first world will buy all the food that would have gone to Africa and the poorer areas of Latin America.

Perhaps. You'd have to turn political awareness into a change in intellectual property law in most countries. Specifically, you'd need rulings that: Protect a farmer from license liability if GM seeds show up naturally. Create liability for ""polluting"" a field with GM seeds on the part of the ""originating"" farmer. Disallow ""owning"" biological strains. Changing law is slow. In the short run, with tens of thousands of ""pirated"" GM seeded farmers... It's pretty cheap to sue. Up front costs are not trivial but quite doable. Early wins pay for wider lawsuits. Laws and precedents today makes wins likely. So dozens of suits leads to hundreds of suits lead to thousands. Suits are a sales tactic. If Monsanto can't collect before planting through marketplace sales they'll collect after planting through litigation. And with each suit will be an offer to settle if the farm chooses to become a Monsanto licensee forever. Since ""leakage"" is guaranteed, so is litigation. There may be diminishing returns once everyone has switched to Monsanto GM seeds, but that is decades away. Now every GM farmer with a non-GM neighbor is lining up Monsanto salesmen and lawyers for negotiation. In other words, when you buy Monsanto seeds for yourself, you're signing up your whole region.    Public sentiment is on Monsanto's side. Unlike RIAA's fiasco suing small children, Monsanto would be suing businesses worth billions. Monsanto has a lobbying advantage over opponents. Monsanto is large with a single voice where the opposition and small farmers are scattered, lightly organized, and underfunded.  So your plan to spread Monsanto GM seeds everywhere is likely to make them more profitable, more powerful, and have greater reach before public policy changes to limit their reach.  Embed QuoteAnswered in sixty minutes via  Paul Núñez."

They are also made to work with external herbicides. Monsanto's seeds are particularly made to work with Monsanto brand chemicals.  The Roundup brand is one of the herbicides that they make. In using these products, some farmers reported at least two things. First, some crops won't grow without the chemicals. Second, tons of chemicals douse the plants during their time in the fields.      So this means people eat herbicides on the outside and on the inside of the final product whether it is made from natural or unnatural components.  If everyone planted these monster seeds/crops, they could ruin the major foods for the entire earth; extinct, never to return. Like other plants, GM plants cross pollinate. Healthy plants in the neighborhood will, without a doubt, be contaminated so the second and future generations of seeds and crops will not be pure. There is already a high percentage of organic and non-organic food contamination sold in stores; including high end health oriented grocery stores. A small percentage of GM is acceptable in some places.      With this in mind, a higher percentage of DNA in healthy people will be changed. Yep. It’s true. There has been reportings of DNA changes in people. There have also been reportings that so much Roundup is used on a daily basis that it is in our air, water, and urine. Never mind the high percentage already in our food. We eat, drink, and breath Monsanto and other companies like them. As a result, more seeds planted will mean more allergies, cancer, celiac, birth defects, and other health issues. Think about it. If everyone planted those seeds, then we would all be contributors to mass destruction. Mass suicide?      Also, if this happens, Monsanto would still hold world power as they may continue to manufacture ways to make their frankenfoods produce better in places where people need help with growing food; poverty, deserts, etc. Also, if they continue to hole a patent on crops that are planted intentionally and those that are accidental, people will still have to do business with Monsanto to live. If the people win law suits against Monsanto, then this will stop.     If Monsanto and their affiliated companies unleash the suicide seed, then we would all be kissing Monsanto’s back end for the rest of our days. Those things cross pollinate too. They will kill any chance of saving seeds for replanting. Suicide seeds only live once. If you plant a crop, it will produce seeds, but the new seeds will be sterile. Monsanto gave a weak/un-solid promise to now use these suicide seeds out of context. I don’t believe them. Money is the bottom line. Anyway, This means that EVEYONE will have to continue to buy seeds from Monsanto for each crop.     Monsanto is already a multi-billion dollar company, but this will definitely give them world domination. People all over the earth will starve because this is very expensive. In America we may have choices of alternative crops, but some other places thrive on wheat, rice, corn, etc. Now, if GM crops were the majority choice for food, the Monsanto can continue to come up with more chemicals to keep away bugs and weeds that have become immuned to their previous herbicides. There was a reporting where a particular weed became a super weed and grew about seven feet tall with a base about the width of a wrist. People will pay to spray weeds rather than walk for hours to pull them. They will save time and money on hired manual labor. It is a vicious cycle.      Some folks/companies who are aware of this very real world possibility are putting heirloom seeds in vaults. We should all be prepared in case the future is a dim one. On a positive note, I think the world will get together and stop this madness. Whether things are good or bad, you can choose to be healthier by purchasing organic foods and heirloom seeds for certain types. Overview - If real food disappears/becomes short in supply, you don't want to plant Monsanto seeds. Not even in desperation. Heck no. You want to plant real food that will be free of GM contamination, free of pesticides and herbicides, and free of DNA manipulation. You want to live. You want the people, animals, and other beings of the world to live. Say NO to GMO and learn more about the subject. The education can help you survive.  Embed Quote"

They produce seeds.If you want to know if the thing you're eating was grown from Monsanto seeds... if you bought it at the grocery store, you can just basically assume that the answer is ""yes"". If it wasn't, it was probably produced by DuPont, which is essentially the same thing as far as a question like this is concerned. (That is, they're a giant agribusiness and they produce GMO seeds. Monsanto is bigger and thus the poster child for anti-GMO, but DuPont is little different.)What you probably really want to know is if it's genetically modified. And the answer is that if what you've got in your hand is a vegetable, then probably not. There were some GMO tomatoes, and there's a little bit of GMO sweet corn out there, but most vegetables are conventional hybrids.The GMOs show up primarily in soy and maize (not sweet corn, but the corn used to make industrial products). This is the vast majority of vegetables grown in the US, but you don't get them on your plate. They're used to feed livestock or turned into other products.If your goal is to avoid Monsanto products, just because you hate them (and they are some mighty dickwads), your only solution is to (a) go to your local farmer's market, and (b) ask the farmer.  Commercial produce is nearly certain to be the product of big agribusinesses, and they nearly always use the most productive seeds they can get; i.e. the hybrids that the major seed companies produce. That's how they got to be the major seed companies.Because of that, local producers also use a lot of Monsanto seeds. If you want to know for sure what seeds were used, you have to ask the farmer. They'll probably be the ones charging the most, though you may find that their products are the tastiest. (Breeding for productivity means not breeding for taste.)Oh, and it means you need to avoid pretty much anything with commercial meat (even the organic products are made with non-GMO Monsanto seeds) or any processed foods, which will almost certainly contain corn or soy byproducts (oils, corn syrup [high fructose or otherwise], etc etc etc).  Embed Quote"

The three genetic elements that are most commonly introduced include the camV35 promoter, the ESPS gene, and the NOS terminator. The camV35 promoter is derived from the cauliflower mosaic virus, which allows expression of the introduced transgene. The ESPS gene allows the plant to become resistant to Roundup, a proprietary herbicide from Monsanto -- it kills ""unwanted"" plants whereas GMO plans survive. It's mechanism of action is that Roundup inhibits the gene product of ESPS such that amino acid synthesis is shut down and the plant dies. The transgenic version of ESPS, however, is slightly different in structure from the endogenous version, and therefore is resistant to Roundup. Finally, the NOS terminator (nopaline synthase) allows for termination and regulation of the ESPS transgene and is originally cloned from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.Very simply the steps are...Extract DNA from your GMO food in question. There are many commercial kits available. This one should do.Once you have your DNA, PCR for camV35, ESPS, and NOS.

This allows the replanting of seed the purchased acreage, and most conventional varieties fall under this protection.  Prior to the extensive full-patenting of biotech traits, all varieties were released under this model.  To my knowledge, all public varieties are still released under PVP.  The PVPA was instrumental to encouraging private investment into self-pollinated, non-hybrid crops such as soybeans.For the most part, the business model and intellectual property law works, though I'd argue the IP laws could use some updates.  Farmers can choose to plant cheaper seed that may be conventional, PVP, or even ex-PVP.  Many farmers choose to take one of these routes.  There are also many competitors with different pricing and marketing strategies; traits are shared through licensing and royalty agreements.  Farmers complain about seed prices, but seed demand is not inelastic.  A good example was Monsanto's Smartstax, which bombed in its first year of sales, largely because it was overpriced Monsanto growth falters as SmartStax yields, pricing raise questions   : Business.A very interesting situation will be the expiration of Roundup Ready 1 on soybeans in 2015.  Roundup Ready Soybean Patent Expiration.  We will likely see many farmers cleaning and planting RR1 seed rather than purchasing from Monsanto or its competitors.  I also expect breeders to incorporate their trait even more extensively than current practice.  Embed Quote"

The workers sprayed it, but the wheat wouldn't die. It was then sent to a university lab in early May.Tests at Oregon State University confirmed the plants were a strain developed by Monsanto to resist its Roundup Ready herbicides that were tested between 1998 and 2005.

It's an ongoing discussion in China, since a lot of people have some really hilarious idea about transgenic crops (such as if you eat genetic engineered food, you'll gene will change...) So I went to ask my friends just what exactly is the harm of genetically engineered crop. And this is a summary of our conversation, it could very well be wrong, I have no way to know, since I really know nothing about this subject. 1, genetically engineered food is safe. Consumption of such food doesn't have any known negative effect on human health. 2, the problem with genetically engineer food is not with safety, but much more complicated and sinister, it's about company monopoly. Unlike natural crops or vegetables, most transgenic food is designed not to produce viable seed. That means if Chinese population (since at the time we're mostly talking about transgenic food in China) relay on foreign seed, they'll have monopoly on one of the most important resources. And that is the real problem for genetically engineered crops, it could impact on a country's livelihood, make it dependent on foreign seed import (unless we have our own genetic crops). I guess with Monsanto, it makes America dependent on a large company, that could be very bad indeed.  Embed Quote"

It is important to note that a few of the other answers here are focused on GMOs and that is certainly part of the discussion, however, it is only a part. The company has a number of crops that have been enhanced with biotechnology but there are also a significant number of crops that Monsanto has enhanced through traditional crop breeding (think Gregor Mendel) or advanced molecular breeding (more precise and yet is still within the same crop species). There are miniature sweet bell peppers, broccoli, melons, etc that have not undergone any biotech changes. On the crops using biotech, a vast number of advances have been made within those crops through breeding and then there are selected traits added to provide a specific effect (insect resistance, disease resistance, herbicide tolerance, abiotic stress resistance or quality improvements). The details are best discussed by scientists, but lots of scientific bodies have weighed in soundly supporting the science as safe once all the tests are run (toxicity, allerginicity, environmental impact, etc), reviewed and regulatory bodies approve them.

Each is different. GMO foods are a recent creation and relatively untested. This question is kind of like asking are peanuts safe. Peanuts are safe for some but now we know they can kill others. Thats why peanuts are always labeled.The companies pushing GE foods are mainly the pesticide companies led by Monsanto. Their tests report their products are safe. But tests by the pesticide companies run less than 90 days. The tests are on rats not humans. The results are controlled and released by the pesticide companies that may be influenced by their profit motive in the same way the tobacco companies were influenced to say cigarettes were not addictive and did not cause cancer. This is why independent research is so important.Do Seed Companies Control GM Crop Research?A number of studies from outside the industry show issues.

Why the FDA does not regulate or require research on GE foods.Genetically modified crops are the result of a technology developed in the 1970s that allow genes from one species to be forced into the DNA of unrelated species. The inserted genes produce proteins that confer traits in the new plant, such as herbicide tolerance or pesticide production. The process of creating the GM crop can produce all sorts of side effects, and the plants contain proteins that have never before been in the food supply. In the US, new types of food substances are normally classified as food additives, which must undergo extensive testing, including long-term animal feeding studies. If approved, the label of food products containing the additive must list it as an ingredient.There is an exception, however, for substances that are deemed “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS). GRAS status allows a product to be commercialized without any additional testing. According to US law, to be considered GRAS the substance must be the subject of a substantial amount of peer-reviewed published studies (or equivalent) and there must be overwhelming consensus among the scientific community that the product is safe. GM foods had neither. Nonetheless, in a precedent-setting move that some experts contend was illegal, in 1992 the FDA declared that GM crops are GRAS as long as their producers say they are. Thus, the FDA does not require any safety evaluations or labels whatsoever. A company can even introduce a GM food to the market without telling the agency.Such a lenient approach to GM crops was largely the result of Monsanto’s legendary influence over the US government. According to the New York Times, “What Monsanto wished for from Washington, Monsanto and, by extension, the biotechnology industry got. . . . When the company abruptly decided that it needed to throw off the regulations and speed its foods to market, the White House quickly ushered through an unusually generous policy of self-policing.” According to Dr. Henry Mill...

They'll cite studies and propose the USA as a perfect case-study of a large population routinely eating and consuming GMO without ill effects.The most extreme opponents will tell you that these foods are harmful and that the American large corporations that make them don't want you to know, and they may propose a conspiracy theory about what these companies are doing.The reality is probably somewhere is the middle: there are no long term studies about these foods. And, probably most damning, no long term studies done by truly independent sources, as well as a very strong opposition by these corporations mentioned above to have such studies. The reason is simple: they could be liable for any potential harm that they cause, plus people would be scared away from their products. Neither thing is good from a business perspective.However, Monsanto is not necessarily an evil company. Their business is to sell herbicides and seeds and they should be expected to do anything in their power to make their business successful. On the other hand, the FDA, whose job is to protect the American consumers, has been perceived by some as too quick to accept the assurances of safety of all GMO producers. The FDA had initially proposed an introduction to the American market with GMO labeling (similar to the EU), but after initial studies found that items like baby food and sodas would need labeling, it gave in to pressure from the Food Industry Lobby. This is what strengthened the conspiracy theories out there.Many people argue that GMO crops saved humanity from impending calamity by increasing yields and allowing farmers in the third world to feed more people than ever before. But others argue that modern growing techniques are also greatly responsible, without the need for stronger and stronger pesticides or herbicides.And then, there's the issue of patent infringement, which is the tool Monsanto and other companies have used to force farmers to buy their seed and drive out of business anyone who interferes with their profits. This has nothing to do with the quality of their seeds or whether its harmful, but it does cast these companies in a bad light.The combination of a Lobby powerful enough to force the US Government to eliminate even labeling of GMO food, plus the lack of serious studies by independent parties, plus the strong-arming of farmers to buy new seed each time they plant (even though this is something farmers had never done before) creates the image of a company capable of doing anything to maximize its profits, including harming its customers. Could they be hiding something? They could. But we know that it is very hard to keep those secrets for long. Not allowing serious studies to find out either way is a better strategy.Personally, I think that what is truly harmful is the type of farming that these companies propose. They invented RoundUp, a very powerful herbicide and then, they created seeds that could survive RoundUp so that crops could be routinely sprayed with it. This is what most Americans ate for the past decade.It doesn't stop there, however. Mother Nature is very resourceful and we have RoundUp-fast weeds that are causing problems to all farmers (GMO or not). So the answer is to spray crops with a cocktail of RoundUp and other similarly tough herbicides, while using the latest ""version"" of their seeds, which resist all of them. Monsanto and their likes are educating farmers about these crops today and they are no planning on changing the strategy. If a new super weed emerges, they'll come up with a new herbicide to add to the cocktail and a few more genes to tweak in their seeds.I don't think this is a sustainable strategy in the long term, and I also believe that it is harmful for all of us. Having a bunch of nasty super weeds growing all over the country cannot possibly be viewed as a ""necessary evil"". The strategy, however, is driven by a small group of guys whose only driver is to make sure the company meets the next Quarter's numbers. I don't think it's very smart of the rest of us to let them decide how we grow crops indefinitely.In closing, Monsanto's seeds and the crops they produce may or may not be harmful for people, but the strategy that the company is currently following is not sustainable in the long term and is already having adverse effects on the environment. It may, if there's a long period between the appearance of a new super weed and its corresponding fix, hinder our ability to grow enough food to meet our needs. But then it'll be too late to try to go back to ""normal"".  Embed Quote"

It is battling controversy even as it slowly spreads around the world.Scared Of Genetically Modified Food? It Might Be The Only Way To Feed The WorldThe evidence for the paranoia so far?So far, there is no conclusive evidence, but no major studies have found genetically modified plants pose a great danger, particularly when compared to the toxic chemical and destructive farming practices we employ today (a recently trumpeted French study [PDF] showing tumors in experimental rats fed GM food was shown to be seriously flawed). Yet those risks have kept countries in Europe and Africa (except South Africa) almost completely GM-free for decades.Scared Of Genetically Modified Food? It Might Be The Only Way To Feed The WorldIt gets worst when factless propaganda influences in desicions that could have potentially save MILLIONS of lives. For example, in 2002 Zambia, where three million people are facing food shortages, rejected thousands of tons of free maize from America because some of it is genetically modified.

short, yes,  Monsanto's products are harmful to humans to eat, but the reasons go far beyond the GMO debate.This questions specifically asks about Monsanto, so I will address Monsanto's products and not make this about GMOs in general.  There is a difference.  Monsanto does not design products to help humanity.  They design products for profit.  They are creating products that are used in vast monocultures, and the ingredients that are processed from Monsanto's crops are some of the worst things humans eat.  Lets name a few:-high fructose corn syrup-hydrogenated fat -corn chips-factory farm feeds that are used in CAFO operations worldwide-White sugar form GMO sugar beets (most likely what you are eating is the label just says (Sugar)-Roundup ( It's not on the label, but if you eat GMOs, you eat Roundup )In the past Monsanto has been responsible or irresponsible for such atrocities as:-Agent Orange-DDT-RBGH ( Growth Hormone for Dairy Cows.You will often hear people make the comment that Monsanto has to prove their products are safe.  Wrong!  Monsanto has a revolving door with its executives and the government.  See the chart below:These are scary places for a company like Monsanto to have high levels of influence.Humans are cutting down South American rain forests to grow more GMO soy to feed animals.  This in the long term will be more harmful than eating the stuff directly.  If Monsanto continues to push its crops this will be all the rain forests:In the short term, you will most like experience little problems form eating Monsanto's GMOs, aside from the fact that GMOs are mostly in the most highly process and unhealthy foods to begin with.  At best you will experience no obvious problems.  At worst you will have mild allergic reactions, stomach aches, and generally feel unwell.  When I consume GMOs without knowing (I avoid them when I know they in something), I feel pretty awful, but I eat so little processed food that it is hard to tell if it is the processing or the GMOs.In the long term it is a big enormous question.  While I think the above is enough to say these products are harmful Let's talk briefly on the GMO aspects.There are 2 types of GMO crops on the market:1) Roundup Ready crops -  Monsanto scientists found bacteria that was resistant to Roundup near one of their factories and someone at the company had a brilliant thought that sounded somethings like this: ""Let's put this in the food supply, so we can make more money!""  They inserted DNA from this bacteria into soybean DNA and when you spray the soy with Roundup the soy lives and every other plant in the field is supposed to die.  The plant drinks the Roundup and the majority of Americans eat it.  Roundup is a mass chelator.  It kills plants by binding nutrients.  When you ingest it, it does the same to you.2)  Bt Crops -  Bacillus thuringiensis is a naturally occuring bacteria that makes the stomachs of insects bust open.  When gathered up and put into a solition in a spray bottle, it can be used as a relatively safe insecticide.  However, it clearly says on the bottle, ""Do not ingest.""  Monsanto had the brillant idea to genetically engineer crops to create this bacteria themselves.  It worked, and now Bt corn makes this bacteria in concentrations 1000 times greater than naturally occurring.  A Canadian study found Bt in the blood of 93% of pregnant women and 80% of their unborn fetuses.Since the introduction of GMOs in the food supply in 1996, there has been a huge spike in chronic illness in Americans. Europeans barely eat GMOs and have significantly less chronic illness.

She had a degree in agriculture.  She went to College when it was not customary for women to go to college.  She was involved with the DeKalb Agricultural Association which was later to become DeKalb Genetics.According to an article published by the Northern Star, Annie lived from 1865 to 1965. http://northernstar.info/campus/...Here is a mural which depicts Annie Glidden on the side of a buiding which is on historic Lincoln Highway in DeKalb, IL.  Annie pictured as a child.A closeup of the mural, which is larger than life like Annie.Also, her uncle, Joseph Glidden, was one of the inventors of barbed wire.DeKalb seed corn was known around the world, and the symbol of the flying corn was recognized by farmers in the United States as well as third world countries.  I do not think DeKalb seed had the same unfortunate reputation as the company Monsanto which bought them out.  I feel a little sad that such a tradition of helping the farmers of the world was perverted when Monsanto purchased the company in 1998.  The current political climate with Monsanto and genetically altered products is pretty horrifying.Women with non traditional careers should be able to be proud of the Annie Glidden legacy rather than ashamed.  She is one of those independent spirits I will forever remember.  If she had not been so involved with the DeKalb Agricultural Association, there might have never been a DeKalb Genetics.  DeKalb high yielding seed corn positively impacted the lives of many people around the world.  Embed QuoteAnswered in eight minutes."

I will list some but may come back later as this is a bit of a brain storm. Working in agriculture is a passion for many of us. There are only so many industries where you really get to work at making the world a better place & agriculture is one. We love working with farmers, knowing our efforts are helping to feed our families and communities. It's amazingly rewarding to talk to farmers in the developing world & hear how much better their lives are cause they have access to improve seeds & agronomic practices. Here in the US we also receive great feedback from farmers who appreciate the benefits our products offer. As employees we have the ability to pursue innovation whether that is in science or in communications approaches, etc. that innovative thought has led to important breakthroughs, particularly in science. We can also be challenged in our career paths by developing various skill sets and choosing different fields. For instance, someone with a research background can later work in product marketing getting a vastly different view of our business. And contributing their unique experience & expertise elsewhere. Frequently these are short tenures as the new info & energy then helps drive innovation in the person's primary field of interest. Monsanto has a very diverse employee base and all have opportunities to do well. This article from BlogHer shares some of that from my perspective as well as some colleagues http://www.blogher.com/hearing-w...There is a long list of awards the company receives based on everything from encouraging health & wellness to the diversity policies to IT. http://www.monsanto.com/careers/...

Let me start with the big picture though and see what I can offer that may be helpful. Controlling weeds is an important part of farming for a couple of reasons:Limiting resource use - when you let weeds grow uncontrolled in your field or garden, they use water, fertilizer, etc that could otherwise be available for the crop you are growing for food. Since our environmental resources like water are finite, good stewardship of them is something that ways heavily on the minds of farmers and is something that the rest of us need to be conscious of as well. Protecting the crop yield -- competing with weeds for water, nutrients and sunlight can make it hard for crops to yield as well. In the case of something like beans, you can get fewer pods to set on the plant and fewer beans in those pods to fill out. Those things are costly since farmers usually get paid on how much they grow and if yields were typically lower, supply and demand indicates food would be more expensive for all of us. Ability to harvest -- some weeds can become so large that uncontrolled areas of a field may not be able to be harvested with machinery. Big losses there which could again effect food prices for all of us and potentially on farm profitability. Quality at harvest -- many crops are destined for food grains and some seed can be mixed in right in the field. I especially remember how much this impacts a crop like rice or wheat where the small pieces of grain can be similar in size and shape to weed or grass seeds. When I go to the grocery to but rice, I like it to be all rice, not for me to have to sort through grains and pull the weed seeds out. Crops that have similar size weed seed contaminate them are discounted and so a farmer has lost some of his earning potential if he doesn't control weeds. Weeds go to seed & increase your problems in the future -- when you let weeds and grasses grow, they will begin reproducing either by seed or from their roots / rhizomes. This means more weeds next year and the likelihood of bigger losses. Farmers tend to think both short-term & long-term so they keep it in mind that handling a small problem now is a lot easier than controlling a big problem later. Over years, fields can have fewer and fewer weeds appear and it means farmers can control weeds more easily. There are a few ways to control weeds. Physical control -- In my garden, I tend to simply pull weeds up by the roots or use a hoe on them. But when you move to larger fields this means running a plow to control weeds before starting the crop or a cultivator during the season to pull weeds up. Plant competitors -- Some farmers find planting cover crops or keeping the field in production in the off season with crops like winter wheat can be helpful as these will compete with unwanted weed species and provide a well-known plant to control. Herbicides for no-till or minimum tillage -- Some farmers find it better to use herbicides instead of plowing as the soil structure gains the ability to hold water better and earthworms develop the soil's health, etc. this is something that has been growing for decades in the US and a benefit we all realize from this is the soil tends to help better filter water so you don't have runoff. Controlling specific weeds & grasses or broad-spectrum control -- there can actually be dozens of types of weeds in a field. Some are broadleaf weeds, others are really grasses depending on the impact what is growing can have & how many species there are, farmers will decide whether to use something that controls a very few weeds or a wide range. The farmer will also consider what is planted nearby, whether there is water nearby, etc.Some herbicides leave a zone of protection in the field & others work based on contact only -- when you first plant a field, knowing what weeds you had there last year, a farmer may want to put out a herbicide that leaves the field protected for a week or so, something that will give the crop they are planting a chance to get ahead of weeds. Other times a farmer may want to just get rid of the weeds that are there. Different herbicides offer different advantages based on the use.As I talked through all of these, it is interesting to me now that I realize there are products and practices that fit all of these examples in conventional, organic and biotech / GMO fields. Hope my answer helped a bit.  Embed Quote"

There is the ‘carbon tax credit’ issue, such as: who has or leaves the biggest carbon footprint? From government down to private industry there is pressure to reduce your carbon footprint or one pays for with increased taxes, fines (in some cases), and/or be chastised by your peers and competitors by losing out on bids to those that do. Cities need to find ways to divert garbage from landfill out of necessity in many cases as there is no land to put the garbage in and many sites thought suitable have to go through lengthy environmental impact assessments, studies, and levels of approval for the considered sites to be deemed appropriate. This being the case the garbage that one puts out on the curb will get a primary sort, usually for metals, plastics, paper products etc. that will be recycled and other, wet garbage, will get diverted and trommeled  (a rotating sieve for sizing or screening) and then either composted, incinerated, and/or, finally landfilled. A City is best off to promote recycling at a grass root level to avoid unnecessary burden on the taxpayer. If you live in a community that recycles it is far more cost effective in both the long and short term for you as a taxpayer, but more importantly, as a member of this planet. Hopes this helps.

Before the filters, they would have to completely drain the tanks every so often and refill them. The filters saved literally hundreds of thousands of gallons of water per year and reduced waste water production.  Needless to say, the company saved buckets of money because of their water saving technique.   So my vague answer to this vague question is: a whole hell of a  lot!  Embed Quote"

Regular care keeps the water clean and balanced, and your equipment functioning properly. With today’s technology, pool maintenance is easier than ever, and should take about 10 minutes a week.The first and most basic step is cleaning. The dirt and debris that inevitably end up in your pool not only make it uninviting, but they can clog and damage your pool’s filtration system as well. The big floating debris can be quickly and easily scooped out with a skimmer, while heavier sediment can be managed by an automated pool cleaner. There are several types of automated cleaners — and each does the work while you sit back and enjoy your pool.The second part of pool care is maintaining the chemical balance in your pool. Chemistry is key to keeping your pool clean, as well as making it a safe, pleasant environment for swimming. Chemicals like chlorine are used to keep algae and bacteria under control, while chemicals like muriatic acid keep the pH levels of your pool’s water balanced. You'll need test strips and a drop kit to check and maintain chlorine and pH levels. It also is important to keep a consistent volume of water in your pool; a lower-than-normal level can make your chemicals too intense and a higher-than-normal level can dilute them and make them ineffective. Improper water levels will also have detrimental effect on filtration and circulation.http://www.swimmingpool.com/main...  Embed Quote"

There are many tools and items available to make your pool owning experience less troublesome. Even if you have an automatic cleaner, you will need the basic equipment. Telescopic pole, skim nets, pool brushes and a test kit are a must for any pool owner. The following is a glossary with descriptions of swimming pool and spa cleaning equipment.Telescoping PoleTelescoping PoleThe first thing you need. Tele poles, as they are called, come in a variety of lengths and quality. The best ones are made from fiberglass, but most are aluminum. They usually extend and then twist lock in place. Most tele-poles have 2 holes at the end that are designed to accept a wide range of accessories that we will discuss below.Concrete Pool Vacuum HeadVacuum HeadsVinyl Liner Vacuum HeadThe easiest way to make a dirty pool look good is a good vacuuming. All pools need to be vacuumed on a regular basis. The vacuum head attaches to the pole, and then a vacuum hose is attached to the vacuum head. The pole and vacuum head are then lowered into the pool. Click onto “How to Vacuum My Pool” for more information. There are two different types of vacuum heads. One has wheels and is weighted for concrete pools (left). The other is designed for vinyl lined pools, and has brushes instead of wheels (right).Vacuum HoseVacuum HoseIn order to vacuum debris from the pool walls and floor, you will need a vacuum hose. The vacuum hose connects to the vacuum head and telescoping pole (both above). Then, lowered into the pool. You then need to fill the vacuum hose with water, and then plug the end into the skimmer suction hole or a dedicated vacuum line. The water and debris are pulled into the filter pump basket via the swimming pool vacuum hose. After you vacuum, you will need to clean the basket and backwash the filter. For more information, Click Here.Leaf TrapLeaf TrapsThe leaf trap is a canister that is placed at the end of the vacuum hose just before the pool skimmer. Inside the canister is a large basket that will trap the leaves and debris before the “pool trash” gets to the pump. Great for leaves, acorns, pebbles and palm tree debris.Skimmer NetSkimmer NetsLeaf RakeThe most popular pieces of equipment around the pool are the skim net (left) and leaf rake (right). The skim net is a flat mesh net that attaches to the tele pole. It should be used on a daily basis to remove debris floating on the pool surface before it can sink to the floor. The leaf rake is also a mesh net, but is much deeper. Great for scooping debris from the pool floor for a quick cleaning before guests arrive for instance.Pool BrushesOne of the most overlooked maintenance steps of pool care is brushing. Swimming pools should be brushed at least Pool Brushonce per week. Brushing removes algae and other films and dirt on pool walls and pool floors that can’t be removed by vacuuming. A weekly brushing will avoid “slimy” walls and slick film that is common with pools and spas. There are several types of pool brushes. Stainless steel is perfect for plaster or concrete pools. Stainless brushes should not be used on vinyl pools. Plastic bristle brushes can be used on any type of pools, and are ideal for above ground and vinyl pools. There are also brushes designed for getting into pool corners and steps. Don’t forget to brush your pool weekly!!Leaf BaggerLeaf BaggerOne of the best inventions for swimming pool cleaning since the telescopic pole is the Leaf Bagger. Sometimes called the Leaf Master, The Leaf Bagger is a jet style vacuum that uses water pressure from your garden hose to create a Venturi affect. The high pressure water pushes the debris into a large bag. The leaf bagger is ideal for a quick spot clean or cleaning a pool floor full of leaves. Available with a leaf  bag, or a very fine mesh bag.Stain MasterStain MasterThe Stain Master is a siphon driven device that can siphon muriatic acid from a bottle on the pool deck to a stain on the pool surface. Sometimes called the Acid Wand. Perfect for small localized stains. Rust stains, leaf stains, acorn stains. Read directions, and follow all safety guidelines.Pumice StonePumice StoneAnother method for removing localized stains on concrete pools is the pumice stone. Pumice is a light porous glassy lava stone that can be rubbed over a pool stain to remove it. You can get a pumice stone that can attach to your tele-pole or a pumice stone that has a handle you can swim with. Works great on cement stains, berry stains and paint.Tile BrushTile BrushesA clean tile band is a very important part of the way your pool looks. As part of your weekly maintenance schedule, you need to scrub the tile band with tile cleaner and a non abrasive brush. Tile brushes come in a variety of and shapes, or you can just use a plastic bristle brush.  Embed Quote"

This makes the stream really unpredictable until the plumbing is properly lubricated. While sitting down makes the target closer and angle easier, it is still possible to create a mess unless one reaches down, and directs the instrument. Additionally, when sitting down the volume of the stream can cause significant splash-back. Finally, a rigid and/or significantly protruding instrument makes sitting down uncomfortable and sometimes impossible.Using ""squatting"" toilets used throughout much of the world would solve most of these problems, but they are considered highly unfashionable by most westerners. Additionally, many westerners find squatting extremely uncomfortable and some simply can't squat or can't squat long enough to complete their transaction.http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Squ...  Embed Quote"

Somebody at the store has assuredly passed a test on it. They may be following the rules; they may just be cutting corners.The main requirement to change gloves is when you go from handling raw meat to handling finished products. There's no raw meat in a Subway; everything is ready to eat. In the rules above, they're not allowed to touch ready-to-eat food with their bare hands, and so they wear gloves.   (You also have to change gloves when the gloves are torn or dirty.)As I said, rules vary from place to place, but there's nobody going to require them to switch gloves in the middle of the assembly process, even if it involves several pieces of equipment. Some places may require them to put on new gloves after handling money, and it's definitely unusual to put on gloves after taking them off.

Removing Debris2. Removing Suspended Organic Molecules3. Disinfection4. Removing other chemicals (optional, depends on region and regulations)Here is my best guess at a cheap option for each of the first 3 steps.1. Removing debris: usually done by a mesh screen. Afterwards settling tanks allow dense material (sludge) to settle and light material (scum) to rise and be skimmed off the top of the water. These can either be incinerated (cheap, polluting, can produce power), landfilled (kind of expensive), or used as feedstock for gasificiation (high capital costs, ""clean"" efficient power generation capabilities);2. Removing suspended organics: After the solids have been removed the WW goes to aeration basins where activated sludge breaks down suspended organic molecules. Areation is energy intensive.3. Disinfection is accomplished either through chlorination (medium-high maintenance, possibly dangerous) or UV (safe, high maintenance).4. Removing other chemicals such as ammonia tend to involve more areation basins, and can cost roughly equal to the original aeration.That being said, wastewater treatment is generally a pretty expensive, albeit important, enterprise. It requires a great amount of infrastructure, capital, and oganization. Depending on the actual implementation, costs for certain things (such as chlorination, landfilling, energy prices) can vary widely. At the same time there is a certain physically/technologically attainable minimum energy cost that is hard to get past.Brown and Caldwell newsletters are generally a good way of staying up-to-date on new technology and methods: http://www.bcwaternews.com/  Embed Quote"

The hypothesis runs that the more you manage people with things like pedestrian crossings, roadside fencing, elaborate signage etc., the more you disable them and disengage them from where they are and what they're doing.There's some evidence for this, particularly associated with Dutch experiments to eliminate the sidewalk/pavement distinction (pavement/road for British readers). This produces slower driving with fewer accidents. However, it's very expensive to do - unlike simply removing the bins! But the underlying thinking is the same. Make people responsible for themselves in space, and they start to behave in more complex, interactive ways.Retrofitting cities this way is fiendishly complex to do systematically, but it's quite cheap just to remove signage, clutter, furniture, waste bins. And it looks nicer. We don't know yet, however, what the effects of doing this piecemeal are - so doing it for three streets, while the remaining 2,000 stay as they were.  Embed Quote"

Or do lots of items smell the same when they decompose?","Lets see if I remember my waste management class... The strongest smelling compound from organic decomposition is Hydrogen Sulfide. This is similar to the smell you may notice around sewers. Combine this with the decomposing organic fatty acids found in food waste, and we get a recipe for garbage odor.Additionally, the bacteria (methanogens) that decompose the waste have similar metabolisms, so they release methane and a few other trace gases that generally combine in the confined space of your plastic garbage bag/trash can to create a mixture of different gases (syngas). The methane in garbage actually has no smell, despite some people claiming that it's the methane that makes your farts smell. At more advanced landfills, this methane is actually used to create energy.Perhaps more info than you wanted, but hope this helps  Embed Quote"

They touch it with their feet, the underside of their bodies, and are in such overall close proximity to it that they pick up additional particulate matter in the air (the tiny particles of feces that drift in the air and form a smell, the same little pieces of floating feces that go up your nose and get detected). When flies land on your food, even if just for a second or two, ask yourself this:  how long do you consider short enough for pieces of feces to touch your food and not bother you?  The answer is probably somewhere close to ""zero seconds"" I'd guess, right?Flies likewise land and wallow around in rotting dead animal carcasses. They crawl all over garbage dumps, inside trashcans with baby diapers and liquifying rotted raw meat and other disgusting stuff, in sewers and gutters, and all manner of horrible places you'd rather not think about.Then the flies buzz over to your sandwich and take a quick little walk with their filthy feet, flutter their wings real fast to make sure and shake plenty of vile particulate matter onto your food, and probably take some little bites of your food with their horrible feces-and-rotten-garbage-tainted mouths. I say ""take some bites of your food,"" but of course flies don't have teeth -- so they just vomit on your food quickly, so the digestive jusices in the vomitus make the food break down and the fly sucks it back up. They suck the vomitus and food up through their little proboscis and mouth, which has all kinds of germs and particulate matter from the garbage and feces.They do this fast, too. Very fast. And maybe when they land and take off quickly again, they just got scared off before they had a chance to finish sucking up their vomit from your food. And those little sticky fly feet that cling to walls and corpses and piles of crap? Sticky poop-and-germ-covered feet, all over your food.So yes, flies landing on anything you touch or eat are a sanitation threat. You can catch germs or get some infection. You may get hepatitis, or pink eye, or a stomach illness like dysentery, or some other form of sickness. Or maybe you won't get enough to get ill, and so you only eat up little bits of fly vomit and feces and garbage particles... lucky you!:(Another perspective, however, is this:  flies are everywhere. Particulate matter from feces and garbage is in the air all the time, and when you smell the scent of poop or rotten meat, that's because little particles float into your face and up your nose, and probably you even taste it a bit when you smell it (there's not all that much difference between smell and taste, ya know).You eat food in restaurants that almost surely had some bugs land on it, that was probably on some kitchen surface bugs touched. You get processed foods at the grocery store that literally have legally allowable amounts of rat feces and hair in them.  You eat and touch little poopy particles and gross garbage particles and things flies and roaches and other creepy little bugs touched, every single day. The only real difference with flies landing on your plate of food is that you SAW IT HAPPEN instead of it being this hypothetical gross thing that took place far away out of your sight and that you can ignore and put out of your mind and pretend didn't happen.  Meaning you should probably worry less about that fly on your bread than the smell from your bathroom at home, if you wanna feel grossed out about what it's really exposing you to.But still, you could counter-argue that just because some other exposure to feces and germs happens at other times to varying degrees, that doesn't change the fact that flies on your food also cause such exposure and is a definite, non-hypothetical exposure happening right there in front of you. So yes, every exposure is one more chance of eating germs or particulate matter that might be responsible for making you ill. And there's no doubt that it's unsanitary.  Embed Quote"

I'll be very careful with my answer, and I'd ask everyone to read it fully before making up their mind about it.Flies touching food are obviously a sanitation threat, which should not be deemed acceptable by any means, but you have to understand that this is just one of the things that may happen to your food, and that several factors - temperature, time, and many many others - affect the outcome of it.If you see a place full of flies, your best bet is not to eat there. Not only because of the flies, but because any place that is full of flies probably exposes your food to other sources of risk.Now, being very practical about it: you may not have seen the fly touching your food. People speak close to the food, or by your side at the table, and their saliva is a tremendous contaminant (which may be as effective or worse than a single fly). Or your food may be touched by something else that was contaminated. Some people use gloves and for some reason, forget to change gloves when they should (which make them worse than a clean washed hand). All of which takes me to the second part of my argument.A few years ago I owned a small food company. I had certified people working for me and my company was constantly monitored by the local sanitation authority. The thing that I found most interesting under food sanitation rules is that it seems that there are two schools. One looks to completely eliminate all possible threats, and advocates a totally sterile and sanitized environment, and is very popular with the media. The other school takes a more practical approach and is very effective in terms of food safety, but allows for some kinds of compromise that while technically correct may surprise some people.There's a concept in food industry called HACCP (hazard analysis critical control point), which is used to analyze threats such as this one with a very practical mindset. It focus on the critical points where contamination or degradation may happen. The goal is to control quality and safety at these critical points. This framework was created to insure food safety for really critical situations, such as supplying astronauts with food for a trip to the moon.Most people don't know but under this system some things may be deemed acceptable. For instance, industrial juice is allowed to have some small percentage of ""non fruit"" parts. Yes, you're reading it right: your industrial juice may have bits of worms and insects that happen to be inside of the fruit when it was processed. It's pure statistics, as it's economically impossible to guarantee that every single fruit was not contaminated by a small bug. But the number is very small, and the pasteurization process just kills anything that may be left there. You'll drink it and you'll never know.In the US, there's also the Food Defect Action Levels (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The...). It states the contamination level that is technically acceptable (if you don't believe me, go and read it; it states very clearly the reasons why it's acceptable, and all the economic and health tradeoffs involved).The same thinking applies to flies and to every other possible source of contamination. Bacteria are everywhere. Food safety rules take this into consideration. So (from a strictly technical point of view) it's different if it's single fly, or a lot of flies, and if the food was cooked before or after contamination. If a fly touches a piece of meat, and the meat is cooked, and if it passes the lab tests for known contaminants, it will be deemed safe for consumption - and you'll never know the difference.  Embed Quote"

Long life milk in asceptic packaging is heated to about 140C for less than half a minute to kill all bacteria, spores and toxins in it. Some bacteria like hotter temps than others.

Sure, it's possible that someone with a cold or flu touched some soda cans at a store and left some germs on it.  But if it's in a cooler and on metal, the odds are rather remote that she would get sick from that (not a very hospitable environment for germs to survive). Overall, I think it's very remote that she would get sick from drinking soda from the can.  We have an immune system and if her's is healthy, she should be able to fight off lots of bacteria and viruses. Does she realize that she has millions or billions of bacteria in her mouth? Plus our bodies are also covered in bacteria all the time, many of which keep us healthy!   I'm actually more concerned about the soda, because there's nothing healthy or nutritionally good about soda! They have refined sweeteners (artificial sweeteners are no better), plus salt, caffeine, acids, colors, etc.  A soda will often spike blood glucose and that will trigger insulin and weight gain. Soda's also use up vitamins and minerals during digestion; they have to take those from other areas as soda's usually have no useful vitamins or minerals included.  The sugar can also contribute to inflammation and digestive problems because refined sugars feed the unhealthy bacteria in the digestive tract and that can actually lower her immune function. http://www.news.harvard.edu/gaze... http://www.endsicknessnow.com/to... I hope that's helpful! :)  Embed Quote"

While it is certainly possible to acquire an STD from kissing, there's a far greater chance of acquiring other diseases from the anus (though STDs are still possible). There are many bacteria -- E. coli, for instance -- that behave well in the lower intestines. The behave quite badly, however, in the upper part of the digestive tract. They can lead to infection and death. There are more bad actors in the instestines than in the mouth.Steps can be taken, of course, to cleanse the anal area and the rectum to minimize the dangers. If that's what you're into, then you should be insisting that those steps be taken. Fecal matter is not food; it is not clean. There are valid medical reasons why feces are kept out of water supplies and the food chain. Going directly to the source of those feces can be dangerous.Does a good washing before anilingus remove bacteria?  Embed QuoteAnswered in twenty-eight minutes."

The bacteria obviously is not native to the lake or ocean or they wouldn't need to add it.I'm 99% sure that the specific bacteria will probably die if there is nothing around to sustain it's existence or when it is outside the range parameters for it to grow and propagate.Using bacteria for projects like the toilets is often much safer and more environmentally friendly than chemicals or high power disinfectants.

The Commonwealth model uses a 'syphon-assisted/pull out' model. The flush-push seems to need more time to achieve vacancy and does it using a heavy, long inflow to get a whirl going. As Jim Gordon's answer mentions, the new US technology uses less water, but is less effective as a result.3) There's a social component to the phenomenon, too.

When you buy a plate of food from a vendor, you pay the price of the meal plus a nominal deposit on the plate (I think it's $1). When you return the used plate to a central dish return, you get your deposit back.Sounds like the Willamette Valley Music Festival used real dishes as early as 2002 (source: http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rec...)Page 9 of this pdf has some more case studies of festival situations: http://ecoclub.com/library/epape...As for take-away re-usable containers, the Davis Food Coop (along with many other Cooperative Groceries) sells bulk food and dry goods. You can bring in any clean container, weigh the empty container so you have a Tare weight, and then fill your box/plate/jar with bulk food. When you check out, the cashier asks you the Tare weight, then weighs the container.  Embed Quote"

Kittens are the most likely to shed oocysts of Toxoplasma.  This parasite infects cats that eat infected meat, such as mice or other uncooked meat (like beef).All in all, your kitchen counters are in much more danger from your uncooked food.  Embed QuoteVia  Anonymous."

I put a lot of thought into how to raise them in ways which minimize negative aspects. See more of my thoughts about chickens here:http://www.quora.com/Brian-Fey/a... Negative:Fence: I had to built a really good fence to keep my dogs and other predators out. People could say, ""Boy I sure would like some of those fresh eggs you got.""Shit:  Their shit is not a negative if you can put down enough ""litter"" to cover the floor well, you can harvest that for your garden. We use massive amounts of pine needles. Sawdust or oak leaves could work. Whatever biomatter is free for you. Or you can have someone with a garden haul it away from free, but the best use of energy is to use it right there. Food : If you don't have a source of food for them, then you have to buy commercial food which can have weird stuff in it. But if you have a number of them which is balanced to your kitchen waste, then they can eat your garbage. I plan to capture and dry many invasive grasshoppers this year so I can feed them that all year long.  Butchering: If you raise them for meat, then you have to process the chickens. De-feathering is a pain. That is why I don't raise chickens for meat, just for eggs. Rabbits are a much easier choice to raise for meat. Rabbits: What makes rabbits an efficient animal to raise?Noisy? If you want to have a cock, then they make noise. However at the home scale it is unwise to have a cock at all. Contact your local farm and either buy pullets, or laying hens. Hens mostly just make cute little noises. I can't think of many real negatives. I think almost all houses should have some hens. Healthy better eggs! And they eat all food waste. 70% of the houses in the little town of Yotatiro near me have chickens!  Embed Quote"

Some bacteria may not be able to grow under such conditions and thus could be rendered inactive or dormant until conditions improve. Killing it is much less likely since the acidity of the environment does not really inhibit any major processes involved with bacteria metabolism or replication (i think?). Now if it was a type of acidophilic bacteria (read: likes acid) then the lemon juice would probably just make things worse by helping the bac grow and proliferateSo in other words... lemon juice isn't exactly the best of options. For disinfectants, use alcohol, and for antiseptics (on human tissue) best to use saline solutions. And for cooking... heat is your friend, and the freezer too if you are planning to store it for long term use. remember... 4-70 degrees Celsius is where you do not want your food to be in for the long term, since bacteria grows the fastest during this period.  Embed Quote"

As to ""going over the natural limits,"" a good number of composting toilets will clearly be needed, but you'd need a lot of toilets in any case. If you can afford it, urine-separating seats (that drain the urine into a container separate from the solid waste) make the composting much easier and pleasant. Urine can be diluted in a 1:6 ratio with untreated water and then used as fertilizer or it can be poured undiluted over sawdust or similar matter and composted separately from the solid waste. The advantage of separating them are: reduces the volume of uncomposted material that is a contamination risk (urine is quite safe to handle), makes it easier to keep the compost evenly moist rather than drowned in liquid at the bottom,  and reduces the smell that fresh waste would produce (the unforgettable ""latrine"" smell is due to the combination of urine and feces). Here's a page with some details: About composting toilets. For some examples of urine separating seats, see Ecovita Products & Tools.  Embed Quote"

In that case, the toilet would most likely be in a dedicated room next to a bathtub so you can relax while taking care of business. An upper class toilet. Notice the wheel on the side to make it resemble a chariot.You would still have to pour water down the drain yourself to push the excrement away. Everyone else had to clean up as best they could using a sponge or a Pumice soaked in brine! If you were really unlucky and your house had no drainage system at all, you would go outside and use the nearest public toilets and clean up with the communal sponges (maybe bring your own?). If you didn't want to go outside, you could use a chamber pot and throw the excrement away carefully somewhere in the yard, in the same place all the other household garbage would go. Neighboring houses usually shared a place for all that. I highly doubt people would throw stuff like that on the street. In any case, everyone would try and schedule their bowel movements for when they could go to the public baths, the place they would be most comfortable in. Public baths were extremely popular, most cities had more than one, they could be public or private owned, and where affordable to everyone. Unlike what the word ""bath"" implies, they were much more than just a place to clean up. They had toilets, warm baths, cold baths, barbers, masseuses, communal areas, even libraries. Baths were so important for daily life, some of them would be luxurious beyond our imagination, like Diocletian's baths, with a capacity for 2,500 people:The Baths of Diocletian.Those who lived in the country used a chamber pot every single day, I suppose.  Embed Quote"

The servants would then empty the bucket's contents out onto the street: if the house was two or more stories, they would just throw it out the window and onto the unsuspecting pedestrians below. If, in the middle of the night, you had to go but didn't want to walk all the way to the bathroom, you could go in a little pot, which you would then push under your bed, and the servant would collect it in the morning. How could they deal with the smell, you may ask? Well, cleanliness was not as appreciated, you may say, as it is today. In fact, most people only took baths once or twice a year. (And this was only for the rich people – the average bloke would be lucky to have a bath once every 3 or 4 years!) Fun fact (as if this isn't gross enough): the reason why the bathrooms were so big was because people believed the strong smell of the pee and what-not would kill any diseases on their clothes. You guessed it, the bathroom was also a closet. So not only did you smell horrible, did the streets smell horrible, but your clothes smell horrible too.  Embed Quote"

The book actually delves into more related topics back to the Greeks and Romans.And as to ''how long ago'', I have the following comment:I recall as a small child, my grandparents had a ''toilet'' attached (outside) to the second floor hallway of their flat, with a clay-pipe down to a sump and open sewer, next to a road in town. It was just a little privy along the lines of an outhouse at the cottage, ''stuck'' to the outside wall of the building. Dumping pails of water after washing floors etc. down this pipe served to ''increase the hygiene''. That was in the early 50's. And oh yes, newspapers cut into squares was the paper you used.Chamber-pots were normal then as well - at least for the liquid jobs or when you were sick in bed.  Embed Quote"

Eucalyptus and tea-tree oil are antiseptic, antiviral and a bactericide*. I would  include cinnamon bark and clove essential oils as well though. They are stronger essential oils and will give a more effective blend.This particular blend of oil is a very strong skin irritant and you do need to make sure it is thoroughly mixed. Clove oil can actually be caustic* (burning). Mix 1 part of the entire mix with at least 10 parts alcohol. Leave in the alcohol overnight. Then mix with the distilled water. Make sure you use amber bottles or opaque bottles. These aren't just for decoration, but to make sure that the sunlight doesn't break down the molecules in the essential oils and cause them to be inactive. Personally instead of an alcohol spray, I'd rather mix a few drops of those essential oils into a perfume free hand lotion. The cream will still be antiseptic and antiviral but not so harsh on your hands, especially during winter. *The Directory of Essential Oils - Wanda Sellar  Embed Quote"

This idea has been popularized as the ""Hygiene Hypothesis"", and it is just that: one of the best guesses that we have in science for the time being.It seems that treating people with pinworms and the like is on the up-and-up in clinical trials for various immune conditions, in an attempt to provide the immune system with a chew toy (and thereby prevent it from manifesting negative effects on our bodies), but the major failure of this theory is that much of the population growing up in the same sanitary conditions have no significant allergies.Personally, I wouldn't read too much into this per se. While the idea has some validity, it clearly doesn't encompass the multifactorial etiology of allergies, e.g. genetic susceptibilities.

Is there a correlation between this and the increase in allergies due to an under exposure to bacteria?","While the theory noted above exists, I personally think it's wrong.  The immune system historically has been exposed to numerous antigens, and ""over sanitization"" likely doesn't make a big impact on the overall number of allergens to which the immune system is exposed.  Allergens-- unlike bacteria-- access mucous membranes in the mouth, respiratory system, and eyes exceedingly often compared to other microorganisms that are eliminated via hand sanitization.  This is because allergens float around in the air in large quantities.Increases in allergies are more likely to result from environmental exposures that likely change from time to time.  During some seasons, allergen production is more robust than other seasons.  Is ragweed more pronounced now than it was before?  This question is just one example of many other questions that, if probed, are more likely to find the real cause for why allergies are more prevalent.As noted above, genetics certainly could explain this, but  evolutionary biology indicates that millions of years are required for significant changes to occur in a species' genome.  So I gather that in our lifetime, there won't be enough genetic changes to explain a change (i.e., increase) in allergies.*DiscaimerThe information on  this Web site is provided  by me  for educational purposes only.

What are some helpful tips to address these two points of discomfort?,"A change of clothes when you get off the plane is great. Just a change of t-shirt / vest underneath your shirt will make you feel fresher. I've found wearing a wicking long sleeve top while you are flying can help you feel less grim. Drink plenty of water while you are in flight as feeling fully hydrated will also help you feel less fatigued after a long flight.Just as an aside (from my flu researcher sister), most respiratory infections on a flight happen at disembarkation in the time between the plane's aircon being swiched off, the doors being opened and you exiting the plane. So don't worry about the germs while you are flying, it is as you land you should feel concerned.  Embed QuoteAnswered in thirty-one minutes."

Very few British houses would have had indoor plumbing of any kind at that time. Such large-scale public projects only really began in the later half of the 19th century. Before that, all water was carried in, and all waste was carried out.As for toilets, a house like that would have had chamber pots, which were occasionally built into closets, but were more normally simply kept out of sight under beds or in special cupboards. These large round or oval enamelled metal pots were often quite elaborately decorated to deflect from their true purpose, and sometimes had lids on them.Each day, the housemaid would have emptied this 'bedroom wear' into a slop sink, which emptied into an open cesspool set some way from the house, or she would have taken them to the street drain in the nearest street to be emptied. Either way, the cesspit was the eventual destination.The women of the house would have used such arrangements exclusively, but the men would probably have used outhouses during the day, which emptied into those same cesspools.The cesspools were emptied at night by the 'Nightsoil' men, and the material was often taken to be spread onto nearby fields as fertiliser. These men were also referred to as the ""Midnight Mechanics"", in the Manchester area.If you are near to the North of England, I suggest a visit to Pockerley Old Hall  which is set in the grounds of the Beamish open-air museum (which is worth a visit, in itself) . It is a recreation of a modestly well-off rural household of the eighteen hundreds, and tries to give an idea of what domestic life would have been like in such a household, back then..  Embed Quote"

Which cleanser should I use - Hand soap, dish soap, or regular clothes detergent? Will clothes detergent be abrasive on my skin? What is the correct motion - twist, foot stomp (grape stomping style), rub together, slap on a rock (Indian style)? How do I avoid the clothes getting warped?","How to Wash Clothes by HandPut on older clothes; clothes that if splashed with water and detergent, won’t be a worry.Be sure to check labels on all clothing and use the correct water temperature.Find, clean and fill a large and clean bucket, basin, sink or bathtub with water. Then, add your favorite dish detergent. (Dish detergent is better because it is not so harsh on clothes or hands.) Depending on the clothes washed—if delicate, use cool water, if regular clothes are used, warm water.Place your clothes into the soapy water. Make sure that the clothes are covered well with the soap solution.Allow the clothes to soak for at least 10 minutes.With your hands or a brand new toilet bowl plunger – (or clothes plunger—some stores have them)—wash or agitate the clothes for several minutes, using gentle but firm motions.Drain the water. Remove the clothes one by one—squeezing them gently and then placing them one by one in an empty sink, a bath tub or a clean, dry place.Rinse the clothes well in clean water. Often, this process takes at least two rinses so that all the soap is removed. Squeeze gently the water from each garment and then hand up everything on a clothes rack or on plastic hangers; being especially careful with delicate items not to pull or squeeze too harshly.Thanks,Susan Smith  Embed Quote"

Most drains are either connected to a sanitary sewer system or septic         tank.          The sanitary sewer carries the wastewater to a treatment plant where it is         processed to reduce and/or remove the wastes. If you are on a wastewater system, all of the drains in your     house are connected to a single pipe that leads to the street. The pipe in     the street collects the wastewater from all the homes in your area and takes     it to a larger pipe that collects wastewater from other streets. The wastewater     then flows into still bigger pipes that connect various neighborhoods. Think     of a large tree with your house at the tip of a branch near the top. Like     the tree branches that are bigger nearer the ground, the pipes in the wastewater     collection system are larger and contain more liquid as they near the wastewater     treatment plant. Here, the wastewater is treated and cleaned so that it can     be put back into the environment without harming anything. After processing, the treated water         may be released to the groundwater or surface water. A drinking water     distribution system looks the same but in this case the drinking water goes     from the treatment plant to your home. 	A septic         tank is just a small underground treatment plant that relies upon bacteria to         ""eat"" domestic wastes. The clean water is then discharged back into the         surrounding soils (the drain field).  Embed Quote"

Transmission (of the agent of Lyme disease) from the tick is almost invariably via tick bite. It can on rare occasions be acquired via a blood transfusion or tissue / organ graft.  Acquiring infection by ingesting a tick would be an incredibly rare event, and would require that the bacteria enter a wound in the mouth. Now, what of a person eating meat or eggs of an animal that is infected? Whereas the bacterial agent of Lyme disease is most abundant in the skin, a few of them may be in other tissues. Even though the risks of acquiring this infection by eating infected animal tissues are vanishingly tiny, all you'd need to do would be to cook the food.  That will eliminate such risk.  Embed QuoteVia  Anonymous."

If so, I've written several articles about this issue.  The SAD (Standard American Diet) is one of the worst in the world, and we are exporting it to other countries!  That diet is high in processed/junk/fast foods, high in refined carbs, salt, fats (especially veggie oils from frying), preservatives, and chemicals, now in the thousands. Many are not disclosed on food labeling.  This diet helps to spike blood glucose and inflammation, both are detrimental to health and arteries.  Plus, those foods lack quality nutrients or balance (vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants). In fact, those processed carbs like wheat and sugar take vitamins and minerals from other areas to complete digestion, creating a deficit. It's been known for several years that the worst LDL particles (small, dense ones), are driven by wheat and sugar, not cholesterol or saturated fats!  In addition, refined veggie oils (high in omega-6) can quickly oxidize in the body, which also triggers arterial inflammation. The only oil I recommend is EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) because it has a set of unique antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. It's great for salads or dressing veggies but frying will destroy the delicate antioxidants.  Smoking, inactivity, stress and a lack of sleep also add to weight, inflammation and compromise immune function. Taken together, we have the perfect storm of a bad diet and other habits which contribute to weight gain, hypertension, diabetes, systemic inflammation and athero! It's so bad, they are finding early athero in young people in their teens and 20s!  Here's are some links for more info and source material: 3 Shocking Myths About Heart Disease http://www.sott.net/article/2425...  Embed Quote"

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I did my Masters in International Health which was public health with a focus on developing countries. I also did this in Australia, so I'm not sure how helpful my answer is going to be but I'll give it a shot for the A2A. I realised I wanted to do International Public Health after a brief stint volunteering in a community based cataract screening and surgery project in Orissa, India. I had previously completed a Bachelor Degree in Human Biology and was in a soul destroying job in a pharmaceutical company, the sole purpose of which was to fund my then expensive taste in clothing (I'm writing this in an man's second hand shirt) and weird obsession with fake nails (ew, gross I know) - things have changed. I went to India not because I had any particular interest in India (now I love it and a little piece of my soul will always reside there) but because I had a crappy day at work and a volunteer thing popped up on my screen and my 21st birthday was coming up and my parents said that I could go on a trip instead of having a party if I wanted. And I applied. I was blown away. First by just how awesome India was, my little slice of Orissa was like a little slice of heaven. But then about the health issues people were facing. What I took issue with though was not the clinical aspect. I wasn't say, super interested in being able to treat a specific child for a specific problem. As a cultural outsider who did not speak the language I really didn't see that as my role. But I was interested in issues of access and equity and resource distribution and epidemiology and initiatves that changed the health of entire communities, of prevention. Rather than returning to the bowels of the pharma industry I thought it better to get the skills I was going to need in my new area of passion. But I also needed experience. So I studied my Masters of International Health at Curtin University (which is in Western Australia) by distance while I worked at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) on a child health project overseen by the WHO. The Australian government pays for my education. They also paid me to work in Bangladesh for that year. Sweet deal huh? The organisation helped me to conduct my Masters dissertation research which was on the care-seeking behaviours of mothers in the first three days after their baby was born in an area where we were running a Village Health Worker project. I loved it. I worked for that organisation for another year, then moved to South Sudan where I worked on am HIV and Gender Based Violence Project for returning refugees. My Masters helped me get my foot in those doors but a key component was contacts. You really would struggle to get anywhere in development work without contacts and I had been getting progressively better at putting myself out there to make them (self-promotion is an uncomfortable thing for an Australian).l then decided that aside from the skills I got from the Masters I needed other skills. I felt strange telling people how things should be done without any knowledge of how one would do them on the ground. I decided to get my training in nursing and midwifery because of that (I did not have the time nor the patience for a med degree!). And as I suspected, reading an article on how to stop post-partum haemorrhage is significantly different from actually trying to stop someone from haemorrhaging.  The break to do this study wasn't all advantages though. I am only now re-enetering public health development work and am doing it at an entry level (HIV and Tuberculosis Public Health Officer in Botswana).  My only tip with a Masters degree is that it isn't about the degree. Reading a bunch of papers to write your own paper should not be the point and will get you no-where. You have to make connections. Which means you have to network. Which means that you attend every event/lecture/afternoon tea that has even the remotest connection to the field you are interested in. And then you go an ask people a whole bunch of questions and see if they need an RA. And you seek out volunteer work and internships. Make the degree work for you.  P.S. If you haven't already its time to develop an intellectual crush on Hans Rosling and Paul Farmer. Enjoy!  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I earned my MPH in 2001 from UC Berkeley. My background was as a biology undergraduate who had spent 3 years doing bench science molecular biology research. As much as this was a wonderful experience (at UCSF and University of Washington), I was interested in population level determinants of disease so pursued an MPH. An MPH by definition is quite broad in its requirements and emphasis, and it is incumbent on the individual to pursue their own nitch. That having been said, I think it is important not to delay pursuing an MPH because you are not sure of you own specific interest. I went in to an MPH with an interest in infectious diseases, and within the first year found a new focus in social determinants of health. My main point here is to not close yourself off to possible interests that you may not know about prior to enrollment - exposure to a variety of areas of practice and research is fundamental to most MPH programs.An advantage of doing an MPH is the flexibility to purse either an applied or research career based on the degree. In addition to switching from an interest in infectious disease to social determinants of health, I also switched from wanting an applied career in public health to being interested in research. If interested in research, of course, it is essential to pursue a doctorate following the MPH. The good news about PhDs in public health is there is much better funding and you generally don't have to take many loans.My concentration was Epidemiology/Biostatistics, which was great. It was essentially a focus on a methodological toolkit that could be applied to various problems. I generally am of the view that subject specific content can more easily be pursued on ones own, and the more technical content of epidemiology and biostatistics is more easily aquired in the formal academic setting (although of course this can be learned through self-study as well if you have the inclination). I wasn't that enthralled by calculus in undergrad, but applied statistics is a whole other thing - I became totally enthralled.The MPH is a big money maker for schools of public health, so there are few opportunities for funding. The best bet is to get a position as a research assistant that will pay for living expenses and depending on the institution, some coverage of tuition. I'm now an Assistant Professor and hire research assistants for 10-20 hour a week positions that pay about $15/hour but also cover a portion of tuition. You will put yourself in the best position for these positions if you have some programming experience in R or SAS or Stata, but there are a variety of positions that are available. Look for postings for positions at Schools of Public Health that you are interested in applying to, or contact Professors doing research in areas that you are interested in. In addition to helping to fund an MPH, working with a research group is invaluable in learning how Public Health research is done. For me, earning an MPH allowed me to have a switch in my career trajectory, and begin to acquire a statistical analytic toolkit, as well as understand theories of disease causation, which were invaluable to me being able to pursue work that was most aligned with my interests. The curriculum is somewhat of a remarkable balance of intellectual and practical application to improving health. If that suits you, you should pursue it. As I once overheard a physician say, if you really want to help people - don't become a physician - study public health.After getting my MPH, I ended up going on to get my doctorate in public health at Harvard, and am now an Assistant Professor at Stanford. So this is a fairly traditional very academic track. But my colleagues in my MPH program have done a number of diverse pursuits, and in almost all cases have found very fulfilling work, ranging from working at Indian Health Services, to medical school to research assistants to environmental advocates.  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I decided to get an MPH while I was serving in the Peace Corps as a community health volunteer in Peru. I had a bachelor of journalism with little (ok, no) background in science. But my skills in communication seemed to translate pretty well to health education, as I could quickly research topics I knew little about and then translate the information into something that was easy to understand. I spent two years working with community health workers and teen promoters on the prevention of HIV, diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, dengue, malaria... I loved it. So when I was getting ready to go back to the States, I looked at the different MPH programs around the country. Many are more research-based, but given my background, I wanted more of a practical focus. In the end I applied and went to Tulane University in New Orleans for their health education and communication program. About halfway through my studies, I discovered I had a strong interest in epidemiology (in a nutshell: the study of how diseases appear and move through populations). My advisor encouraged me to explore other departments, and I ended up taking about as many courses related to epidemiology as I did in health education. I was fascinated and found I was most comfortable when I worked with the two concentrations in combination. My experience was enriched a lot by being in New Orleans. It's a wonderful but in some ways still-struggling city, where many of the public health concerns I learned about in the classroom were right there in my neighborhood. Instead of a research thesis, we were required to complete 300 hours of practicum. I did mine at the New Orleans Health Department and also volunteered at a safety-net clinic. Being a part of the health community there not only complemented my studies, but also helped confirm that I was in the right field. So that's the good stuff. The financing was the hard part. My program was expensive, with very few opportunities for scholarships or grants. I and most of my friends financed our education with student loans. For me it was worth it. Even after graduating, I'm still fascinated by current  research and bore (or sometimes horrify) my husband and friends with health-related trivia. Studying public health made me healthier. More in tune with what's going on in our world and more knowledgable about how policy and environments can affect how healthy we are. But that's me. I'd be interested to see how my experience differed from others here on Quora.  Embed QuoteVia  Ming Law."

How did you know you wanted to go into Public Health? How did you finance it? What was your prior education & work experience?What is your personal story leading up to, during, and after the MPH?","I received my MPH in 2006 with a concentration in environmental public health. I was teaching environmental science in high school at the time and my thought was that the degree would improve my teaching but would also give me additional opportunities outside of teaching and would give me the skill set I need to have a positive impact on the environment.I found that the degree on its own didn't have a lot of teeth; I read a lot of books and wrote a lot of papers but I didn't come out of the program with any tangible skill set. If I had focused on biostats it would have been a different story but the environmental concentration gave me the opportunity to do environmental compliance work.It turned out I hated that work; it's basically writing reports showing that your company isn't doing anything wrong. It's a lot of ""I"" dotting and ""T"" crossing.  Most of the jobs that I have seen for environmental related work tend to veer towards government/industrial environmental compliance - other environmental jobs seem to require a background in environmental engineering or industrial ecology.If I had complimented my MPH with another degree, like a masters in environmental engineering or law then maybe I could have had greater opportunities within the environmental field - I am currently looking into a data analytical program to compliment my knowledge with learning to use large data sets for urban sustainability.My caution for anyone interested in an MPH is simple; on its own it probably won't expand you into a ton of opportunities - use it to improve your quantitative skills or complement it with another degree to really stand out.  Embed Quote"

Hydrocarbons vary a lot. Some are worse than others. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, benzene is a carcinogen, and butane and pentane cause smog. On the other hand, ethylene is naturally produced by plants and heavier petroleum products like mineral oil and vaseline are safe enough to eat/drink. Unfortunately, hydrocarbons are usually mixes of very-toxic compounds and not-so-toxic compounds. So when you spill them, you don't know whether the spill will biodegrade, or cause air pollution, or whatever else. That's why it's safer to assume that all hydrocarbon spills are bad, just to be safe.  Embed QuoteAnswered in thirty-three minutes."

You can check out their website here: HomeThey have found Vietnam air pollution among the worst in the world – specifically ranking 123rd, one of the 10 worst nations. Meanwhile, China rank only at 116th.As somebody who has lived 20 years in Ho Chi Minh City, I can attest to the degrading air quality. Now we officially has smog, what the UK had back in the Industrial Revolution of 1700s.

Yes they're over regulated, if you feel you're doing too much work for any sort of public gain. Agriculturalists often feel over burdened when regulations are made far outside the current industry best practices. One example is the recent egg laws to prevent salmonella initiated after the outbreak in 2010. Salmonella is everywhere, but since the law was initiated the increased surveillance has found no more salmonella in eggs. The food is no safer from a farmer's perspective as they already do everything they can to keep their eggs safe for consumers.On the other hand, if something bad happens environmentally, human nature is to look for ways to prevent this from happening again. Regulation often seems to be a sensible answer. And from that perspective, as air and water quality readings improve to an acceptable level, regulation was needed. My opinion:Somewhere in the middle there is a balance, and America is great because everyone has an opportunity to make their case for where the middle is. A blanket answer is hard to pinpoint. There are some (okay, many) areas I think could be less regulated with no risk for food safety or animal welfare. There are other areas (okay, few) where agriculture needs to be regulated more to improve animal welfare or food safety.  Embed Quote"

Chen's answer to Is organic food better for you? for details","Apparently nothttp://blog.al.com/frugalmom/200...A total of twenty-eight harvests were made including sixteen of lettuce, four of strawberry, four of tomatoes, and four control lettuce batches. Each batch was divided into seven treatment groups. One group was analyzed in an unrinsed state as received from the field; one group was rinsed under tap water for one minute. The five remaining groups were individually treated with either FIT®, Fruit & Vegetable Wash Organiclean, Vegi-Clean, or a 1% solution of Palmolive® and then rinsed under tap water for one minute. In the case of the control lettuce batches all seven-treatment groups were processed in an unrinsed state to ensure that each group contained statistically equivalent pesticide residue levels.A total of 196 samples were processed. Detailed statistical analysis showed that in all cases at least one group was different from the rest. Pairwise comparison showed that the group that was different was the unrinsed produce. There is little or no difference between tap water rinsing or using a fruit and vegetable wash in reducing residues of the nine pesticides studied. The removal of waxes and/or dirt from the produce was not examined as part of this study.If you did not take the time to read all of the mumbo-jumbo written above, here is the quick answer: there was NO difference in the levels of pesticide found on the produce! It did not matter if you washed it with any of the special washes or with watered down soap: they had the same effect as washing with plain old tap water for one minute.Also, some pesticides, particularly neonicotinoid pesticides, are systemic pesticides that are present throughout the entire plant. See examples belowImidacloprid can be applied to many vegetables (including tomatoes and leafy greens) right up to the day they’re harvested.Thiamethoxam was first approved as a seed treatment for corn in 2002, and thiamethoxam products that are applied to the soil have since been approved for use on most vegetable and fruit crops. See a photo of seed corn treated with this chemical.Clothianidin is used as a seed treatment on canola, cereals, corn and sugar beets, and as a soil treatment for potatoes.Dinotefuran can be applied to soil or sprayed on leafy greens, potatoes and cucumber family crops.Read more: http://www.motherearthnews.com/o...

I find that a product called Aqua-smart to be the best because partial size is about the grain of sand and is easier to incorporate in the soil.It seems to last about 3-5 years, I have not heard about any long term toxic effects, most manufactures of these products don't have any difinative answers when asked. I think more reaserch needs to be done.It's great to use in sandy soils or where irrigation coverage is spoty and not efficient.

Common methods to remove these compounds (and thus VOCs) include combustion control (low NOx burners), wet scrubbers, and fabric filter dust collection systems (baghouses).

This new study found evidence that this low-grade inflammation is evident in the hippocampus.In mice that breathed the polluted air, chemical messengers that cause inflammation -- called pro-inflammatory cytokines -- were more active in the hippocampus than they were in mice who breathed the filtered air.""The hippocampus is particularly sensitive to damage caused by inflammation,"" Fonken said.""We suspect that the systemic inflammation caused by breathing polluted air is being communicated to the central nervous system.""‎""Male mice exposed to reaerosolized nPM for 10 weeks (3 days/week, 5 hr/day; 150 hr total)""that's a pretty realistic exposure too===http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele...

I will assume that it is something that you can both see and smell, perhaps best described as road haze.There are numerous sources of particulate matter that are not directly related to the exhaust of a gasoline powered car. Among them are dust from tires, brakes and the road itself. Diesel engine exhaust, of course, remains the greatest source of visible particulate matter. Progress has been made to greatly reduce diesel exhaust PM and there is still a long way to go. In any case, I think we are stuck with the substantial dust pollution from the abrasion of tires, brakes and roads no matter how clean the combustion process becomes. In this regard, cabin air filters are a great idea.  Embed Quote"

If you're assuming that you have an air conditioner on, then I would say that the amount of air the air conditioner is pulling in is probably vastly greater than the amount of air that would be exchanged by diffusion or convection through a doorway, so difference in temperature between inside and outside wouldn't make that much difference overall.If you assume that there is no machine drawing in or expelling air from inside the building, you're still left with a few different possibilities.I assume that you mean this for a real-life scenario.  In that case, it's not possible to have a uniform pressure system, because there's just too much going on.  Since your house, in general, is not airtight, you can't even have uniform pressure in a single room.  Even a beam of sunlight streaming through the window will heat the air in its path, changing the density and causing convection currents.Convection currents are the main driver for movement of particles in air.  Pure diffusion of these particles would make it take years before you could smell an air freshener you plugged in on the other side of the room.With this in mind, a big temperature difference will drive faster convection.  However, there are two caveats to this.  First, the range of temperatures that you are likely to experience in your house/outside isn't really all that large. It won't drive crazy convection on a small scale.  Second, most indoor air pollution comes from sources inside your house, to the degree where, except on the smoggiest of days, your house is the net pollution creator.The physical result of this is that if your house is 70 degrees when it's 30 out and you leave the door open, yes, you'll probably feel a little more airflow than if it's 70 inside and out (or, God forbid, 30 inside and out) and you leave the door open. That airflow will contain pollutants, probably, but it will generally be fresher than the air it's replacing from inside your house. So the net flow is probably actually pollutant-negative.  Embed Quote"

They may be preyed upon by top (apex) predators, and may also compete with them for prey in lower trophic levels. Typical mesopredators in much of America include cats, raccoons, and skunks. What constitutes a mesopredator varies between communities; coyotes may be top predators in some communities and mesopredators in others.The mesopredator release hypothesis proposes that as populations of top predators decline, mesopredators begin to increase as they are less likely to get eaten by top predators, and also no longer have to compete with top predators for prey in lower trophic levels.A major prediction in some formulations of the hypothesis is that as mesopredator populations rise, there will be more pressure on prey species. Some of them may go extinct, leading to a drop in biodiversity. The hypothesis remains controversial in part because it discusses top-down effects in trophic cascades - the effects top predators have in structuring communities - while ignoring bottom-up effects - the control that producers and primary consumers might have on higher trophic levels. It's not a universally accepted hypothesis.(A typical mesopredator. Note the guilty look in its eyes.[1])Obviously, humans don't like having top predators like wolves wandering around cities and suburban areas, so top predator populations tend to decline pretty precipitously in areas undergoing human development. In addition, because about 90% of energy is lost at each trophic level, top predators need more area to subsist. Since human development tends to fragment natural environments, it especially hurts apex predators.But testing the mesopredator release hypothesis and its effect on prey abundance and health is tough. Ecologists tend to frown upon shooting all the top predators in an area; it's not a great strategy to test how ecosystems get ruined by ruining more ecosystems. And because the hypothesis has not been extensively tested, it's still controversial.The classic study on this is Crooks and Soulé's ""Mesopredator release and avifaunal extinctions in a fragmented system,"" published in Nature in 1999. Based on the disappearance of coyotes (the apex predator) in southern California, the study concluded that the number of coyotes in a land fragment was positively correlated with bird abundance and diversity, and the number of mesopredators was negatively correlated with bird abundance and diversity. The results were (mostly) highly statistically significant. The study also identified domestic cats as especially problematic species in SoCal, especially since they thrive far above carrying capacity due to ""nutritional subsidies"" from their owners.(taken from Crooks and Soulé, 1999)A mathematical model for mesopredator release is proposed in Courchamp et al. ""Cats protecting birds: Modelling the mesopredator release effect"" (in Journal of Animal Ecology, 1999). The system of differential equations can result in a number of different states, but in general it seems like top predators have a positive effect on ecosystems, and their elimination can hurt prey abundance. (The study says little about diversity, since it uses one ""generic"" species to represent each trophic level.)""Trophic control of mesopredators in terrestrial ecosystems: top-down or bottom up?"" by Elmhagen and Rushton (in Ecology Letters, 2007) examined the decline of lynx and wolf populations in large swaths of Sweden on the rise of the red fox to dominance, while also studying the effect of the productivity of the land, a bottom-up effect. The authors concluded that the top-down effect of mesopredator release was amplified in areas of high productivity; in short, the top-down and bottom-up effects interact.A few other important studies:""Song sparrows, top carnivores, and nest predation: A test of the mesopredator release hypothesis"" by C. M. Rogers and M. J. Caro (in Oecologia, 1998) was a study of the effect of the elimination of large canids and felids in southern Michigan on nest-destroying mesopredators like raccoons. It supported the hypothesis by showing that the reintroduction of coyotes helped song sparrow nests succeed.""Positive Effects on Game Species of Top Predators by Controlling Smaller Predator Populations: An Example With Lynx, Mongooses, and Rabbits"" by Palomares et al. (in Conservation Biology, 1995) was not experimental but showed a similar result; game species like rabbits tend to be more abundant in areas with top predators.""Cascading Effects of the Loss of Apex Predatory Sharks from a Coastal Ocean"" by Myers et al. (in Science, 2007) is one of the major studies documenting the effect in marine communities. Reduction in large shark populations on the East Coast of the U.S. is correlated with in increase in populations of smaller elasmobranchs (rays, skates, small sharks), which has led to the decimation of many commercially important shellfish populations.There have been dozens more studies on mesopredator release, almost all of which seem to confirm that it has a negative effect on prey. A comprehensive review is Prugh et al.'s ""The Rise of the Mesopredator"" (in BioScience, 2009). The evidence for the mesopredator release hypothesis seems pretty strong, although I wouldn't be shocked to discover some kind of unintentional confirmatory bias at work. I'd like to see more work along the lines of Elmhagen and Rushton's study, seeing how these top-down effects interact with bottom-up effects.The irony of all this is that many people persecute top predators on the premise that they compete with humans for game species. The reality is that killing off top species will likely hurt game species rather than help, thus throwing the ecosystem's health off balance. The implications of the mesopredator release hypothesis suggest that if humans need to develop more land, we'll somehow need to figure out how to do that without causing even more fragmentation. Either that, or we'll have to coexist with the top predators - and I don't see that happening.[1] I found this photo on some random site on the Internet, but it has been traced back to Corey Arnold: http://www.coreyfishes.com/ If you are Mr. Arnold or someone affiliated with him and want this image removed, contact me and I'll take it down immediately.  Embed QuoteVia  Anonymous."

There are no residential uses, and no agricultural uses that could result in exposure to maneb in residential settings(from http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs...)Bolded part is wrongSee this study (journal article is linked): http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele...That epidemiological study didn't examine farmers who constantly work with pesticides but people who simply lived near where farm fields were sprayed with the fungicide maneb and the herbicide paraquat. It found that the risk for Parkinson's disease for these people increased by 75 percent.Now a follow-up study adds two new twists. Once again the researchers returned to California's fertile Central Valley, and for the first time have implicated a third pesticide, ziram, in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. Second, instead of looking just at whether people lived near fields that were sprayed, they looked at where people worked, including teachers, firefighters and clerks who worked near, but not in, the fields.Also, atrazine (which is a triazine herbicide)In 2006 the EPA concluded that the triazine herbicides posed ""no harm that would result to the general U.S. population, infants, children or other... consumers.""[4]Yet...Some studies suggest that even the concentrations meeting U.S. federal standards may be dangerous, with implications for human birth defects, low birth weights and menstrual problems.[1] Findings from further studies released in early 2010 have tended to support the conclusion that even low doses can increase health risks, leading to calls for further testing and renewed EPA evaluation of atrazine's safety.[21]In August 2009, Atrazine was prominently featured in the New York Times as a potential cause of birth defects, low birth weights and menstrual problems when consumed at concentrations below federal standards.[1] A Natural Resources Defense Council's Report on Atrazine suggested that the EPA is ignoring atrazine contamination in surface and drinking water in the central United States.[22]===Also, the September 11 aftermathSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chr...Whitman appeared twice in New York City after the September 11 attacks to inform New Yorkers that the toxins released by the attacks posed no threat to their health.[27] On September 18, the EPA released a report in which Whitman said, ""Given the scope of the tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington, D.C. that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink."" She also said, ""The concentrations are such that they don't pose a health hazard...We're going to make sure everybody is safe.""[28] Later, a 2003 report by the EPA's inspector general determined that such assurances were misleading, because the EPA ""did not have sufficient data and analyses"" to justify the assertions when they were made.[29]A report in July 2003 from the EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response gave extensive documentation supporting many of the inspector general's conclusions, and carried some of them still further.[30] Further, the report found that the White House had ""convinced EPA to add reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones"" by having the National Security Council control EPA communications after the September 11 attacks.[31] And the result of that? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hea...An ongoing Pennsylvania State University/Monmouth University study reported that respiratory illnesses grew by more than two hundred percent in the year and a half after the September 11 attacks. (This was the first study that monitored police officers at the Ground Zero site. It was published in the ""Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine."") In this study of 471 police officers, 19 percent of the officers in October 2001 experienced shortness of breath; 44 percent of the officers experienced shortness of breath in April 2003. The percentage of the 471 officers coughing upphlegm increased from 14 percent in October 2001 to 31 percent in 2003.[20]A 2006 medical study of fire fighters reported that those personnel who inhaled Ground Zero air essentially lost 12 years of lung function.[20] Additionally, a Mount Sinai report found that 70 percent of recovery and rescue workers reported an increase in debilitated respiratory function between 2002 and 2004.[20][21]A 2008 report by New York City's Department of Health indicated that up to 70,000 people might have long term health problems due to the dust. The findings were the result of the city's health registry of September 11 first responders, residents, and others.[22]  Embed QuoteAnswered in one minute."

No product is %100 effective, and the more porous a material is the more unlikely it becomes that all mold spores can be removed. In situations where we come across moldy mattresses, we dispose of the mattress. If the customer wants us to clean it anyways, we get a limitation of liability form signed so that they are aware that by not allowing us to work to our industry standard, they will be assuming the liability for any future issues that arise from microbial growth.Vinegar is not really effective or recommended as a fungicide or biocide. You could pour a 50/50 bleach water solution onto the upholstery, which would likely ruin it. It is an EPA recommended method. I personally don't recommend it though. Bleach is not proven to be effective either, and it will only really have a strong effect on previously cleaned, non-porous surfaces. A cushion is not that at all. Whatever liquids you apply, unless you are using some mechanical force to inject it into the cushions, there is no real way to ensure that it is going to come into contact with the entirety of the affected materials. A bigger problem is that most mold spores are hygrophobic. When you start applying liquids, they start reacting. Some, by releasing spores, some by excreting mycotoxins. Any surface, porous or not, that we apply a microbial solution to must first be thoroughly HEPA vacuumed to reduce the spore count. An abundance of mold spores is no less a potential hazard than an area of active mold growth. They are allergens, some are toxic, and all will take root and grow if suitable conditions return.So, if re-upholstering or ""junking"" the car are not options, and you really must try to clean the mold of of the upholstery and out of the cushions, I would have your car's upholstery professionally steam cleaned by an outfit that has experience dealing with mold. Many carpet cleaners run a water damage service on the side and have the experience, and so the the big outfits like Service Master or Servpro. The scope of work I would recommend is this:1. Thorough HEPA vacuuming of all surfaces in the car.2. Ultra Low Volume Fog with MDF-500, Sporicidin, or some other product specifically labelled as an EPA registered FUNGICIDE. (Very important.)3. Steam clean all upholstery in the car. Multiple passes on all affected areas. Rinse should have an antimicrobial product, or follow cleaning with another ULV fog.4. Dry the car thoroughly. Preferably, mechanically with air movers and dehumidification. It is critical that the upholstery be completely free of excess moisture.Anything less than that, and I wouldn't be confident that the mold remediation was effective. The stuff is tougher to kill than most give credit, and spores left behind can ensure the problem will be ongoing. I warn against band-aid solutions. Not stopping this thing dead in its tracks will cost more in the long run than having it done by experts.  Embed Quote"

So the material itself is just cotton. Insulation can also be made from cellulose which can also be made from recycled materials. Both are available as batts or loose for blowing into an existing cavity.The thing is that both denim and cellulose are flammable so in order to use them as insulation, they have to be treated with chemicals so they can't catch fire. They also have to be treated with chemicals to prevent the growth of mold. Of course, the old stand-by is fiberglass. Some companies are starting to use recycled glass to make the fiberglass. Fiberglass doesn't require chemical treatment to prevent fire or mold, but it does need a binder chemical to hold it together in batts. These binders often contain formaldehyde. If you're going to use the loose insulation to fill a cavity, it doesn't need a binder, so no formaldehyde.I used the recycled denim in my own house. I like the idea that the insulation was made from something that was going to be thrown away otherwise. The fire-retardant chemicals used are not really that bad, as I understand. Plus, once they're sealed up in the walls, I don't think much will seep through to the living space.  Embed Quote"

There is pump and treat. The treatment would be determined by the site and contaminant. You could have air striping, reverse osmosis, filters, introduction of biological agents such as bacteria, activated carbon, other chemicals to neutralize or bind with the contaminant for removal. Many of these options are used in combination with one another. The pumping is used to prevent the plume from spreading further. If it isn't a deep water contamination sometimes curtain drains similar to leachate pipes in landfills are used to contain it. Treatment can be done either on or off-site. If onsite the clean water is can be irrigated back on the site with sprinklers or similar to eventually return to the aquifer, pumped into a return well, or disposed into a sanitary sewer. If offsite, the contaminated  water is brought to a certified treatment facility for disposal. The very last resort, if it cannot be cleaned, is to try to contain the plume and forbid the use of the aquifer for irrigation and potable use.   Embed Quote"

It was basically a nice cozy place to sleep without the possibility of being picked off by a predator and a 5-star meal.   I would usually catch the same bunch of animals over and over and by the end of the summer, I honestly believed that the mice would look back at me, give me a thumbs up and say ""see you tomorrow night"".  At one of my sites I had what I believed was a herd of squirrels that would come along, open up all my traps (by lifting an aluminum lever), eat my food and jet.  So after a few nights of this, I basically decided I, a mere mortal human, would outsmart the squirrels.  Night after night, I increased the number of steps and the complexity of movements required to get into the traps.  I failed miserably.  They got through 8 or 9 steps to be able to lift that little lever.  All this to say, squirrels are f-ing smart, they can remember a whole lot of sh&t and a sequence of it but is it required for survival, maybe not necessarily.  Embed Quote"

Maybe some of these are accurate.  But, cleaning up really polluted sites presents huge engineering challenges and, by nature, is going to take time -- maybe more time than it took to pollute the sites in the first place.  And cleaning a really polluted site to greenfield standards just doesn't make economic sense.  Embed Quote"

Some of them accumulate and some of them do long-lasting damage to cell membranes and DNA. Meanwhile, CO is nontoxic to plants and doesn't do damage to cell membranes/DNA. It's acutely toxic (just because it takes up hemoglobin slots that oxygen would otherwise take up), but people have already adopted safety measures for the acutely toxic things. They just systematically underestimate the risk from the things that aren't acutely toxic, but that can do long-lasting damage.Yes, I know that sublethal doses of CO can be bad. But these are related to oxygen deprivation and not the effects of CO itself. To the extent that CO doesn't significantly depress the body's usage of oxygen, I don't worry about it as much as I worry about the VOCs and particulate matter.But, I'd really like to see anyone else who might say something else.","In the UK, in Post-Mortems (autopsy) we do not routinely screen for Carbon Monoxide in the blood (COHb) , we do not know how big a problem it is. A good document is the Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide - to me it seems we are tolerant to low levels (concentrations)  of Carbon Monoxide over short periods, the real issue comes with low levels over a greater period. The drive for better insulation in the home, fuel efficiency and airtightness in building I personally believe means this issue will grow in importance. At he moment I campaign hard to just get Working Smoke Alarms and Working Carbon Monoxide Alarms into homes, but I think they will come a time, where we will have Wifi or Zigbee enabled Alarms and our iPad's (Tablets) will graph the CO in our homes over time.  Embed Quote"

However, in many other countries there is not the understanding, the commitment or the resources to apply similar levels of protection.The problems are often made worse when industrial (or mining or similar) facilities close down, normally because they are no longer making enough money for the owners (who may be private or public but are often hard to track down). Whatever employment opportunities existed – usually meager – are immediately lost, leaving contaminated workers, buildings and surrounding fields as an unwanted legacy. In the worst cases, the operators of noxious facilities have gone to considerable lengths to avoid having to deal with their dung. There are many cases of sludge being trucked away to end up in fields and wetlands, of midnight dumping to sewers and even of toxic wastewater being pumped down wells in frightening displays of “out-of-sight” management.The cumulative scale of these problems is immense. Work by WHO and the World Bank has produced estimates that perhaps 20% or more of the premature deaths worldwide are related to environmental factors.Dirty water and polluted air are the two biggest issues and WHO also notes lead (Pb) as one of the major environmental risks.The real tragedies, however, are often at a local scale, where the contamination can be hundreds of times greater than global standards. In these communities impacts can be immediate and deadly as well as indicating slower poisoning.Examples can be found in all of the Top Ten and in other sites nominated for listing. In every location, legacy pollution levels exceed all local and international standards for toxic substances.A particular concern in all these cases is the accumulation and long lasting burden to the environment and to the bodies of people most directly affected. Closing a factory or putting treatment on a discharge will stop the immediate cause and prevent further contamination. Despite the immense value these steps add, they do little to deal with what has already been released to the environment.For this reason, a key focus of Blacksmith’s work and a fundamental criterion for identifying the World’s Worst, is the nature of the pollutants. The biggest concern is heavy metals, such as lead, chromium and mercury; and long lasting chemicals such as the “Persistent Organic Pollutants” or “POPs’. These are generated and released from a wide range of processes and industries, although there are a number of main “known offenders” and common patterns.""The PDF linked below has detail on each site and further locations.http://www.blacksmithinstitute.o...  Embed QuoteAnswered in eleven minutes."

Occasionally, homes may be 'with' hundreds or even thousands of these spiders, yet the human residents won't likely be bitten. I mention this mainly so folks better understand that the actual risks are low, and accept the inevitable - that they can share their environment with a few creatures that they'd otherwise find undesirable.  A few spiders may offer greater benefit than risk.  With this said, there are means to reduce the abundance of these and other spiders.  For those already in the home, a vacuum cleaner can be a useful tool. Installing and maintaining screens and door sweeps and caulking up penetrations in the foundations and walls can reduce the frequency that pests will enter.  Adhesive traps will help monitor and remove some pests that are wandering about in the home. Pesticides can certainly be of value, but it frequently makes sense to have these selected and applied by a licensed professional.  Embed Quote"

Sadly, bottled water is not made by chipping away bits of pristine arctic glacier, it's just water that travels though pipes and taps. The only real difference is that most bottled water is filtered a bit, to improve it's flavor, but in terms of overall safety or quality there is little difference and some sources suggest that many brands of bottled water may be less safe/clean than typical tap water.  If you are worried, you can buy a home filter system, and as long as it is properly maintained it should provide you with decent tasting water for less money than buying bottled water.

I would include things like Febreeze, Glade, Lysol, etc. in this group. If I'm mistaken please let me know.With this in mind, Alex K. Chen referenced a good article regarding some of the top-selling air fresheners and their toxicity. However, I would like to take this one step further and mention that any aerosol can be toxic. There are two factors to consider. 1) First off, you want to consider the active ingredient(s). The entire point of a masking agent is to overwhelm your olfactory receptors [1] with a high concentration of a chemical that smells ""good."" The issue here is twofold. First off, if you're in a room of concentrated Lysol (let's say) spray, then your supply of oxygen is low. This would be an extreme, but it would be toxic in the sense that it would deprive you of oxygen. The more likely scenario is that you overuse the product and end up with some of the active ingredients actually entering your bloodstream (the nasal endothelium is relatively easy to cross, as it is thinner than some other external barriers [2]—a thin layer of mucus and then a few thin layers of cells before you hit blood vessels). In this case, you have an aromatic compoundAbove is the basic structure of benzene, the most basic aromatic compound (C6H6). Since it is relatively small and non-polar, it can cross the blood barrier easily. A quick Google search shows one of the active chemicals in Febreeze as Granted, in biochemistry, size does matter. But if you take the time to look carefully, you would notice the symmetry present in the structure (Febreeze, apparently, uses the beta form). The hydroxyl groups (-OH) are hydrophilic, making even more likely to permeate the bloodstream, as electrochemical forces would be pulling the Beta-CD into the blood. I don't currently have access to all the articles I would like, but if a molecule like this were to enter the brain, it would interfere with special sub-processes of the brain (I think they're called pi-electron fields?). At any rate, large molecules like the ones above can easily capture free electrons and hold them, meaning they would disrupt cellular metabolism in any organ in the body, though none as pronounced as the brain. On top of this, it is likely that there are ways for the above molecules to use their hydroxyl groups to bind to neurons and interfere with normal functioning. I can't back this up right now, so I'm just going to toss it out there as a semi-logical conclusion. 2) The other thing to consider with any aerosol is the propellant used. CFCs had their claim to fame with air conditioners and refrigerators a few decades ago, so now one commonly used propellant is compressed carbon dioxide. Holding down on the trigger allows some of the CO2 out, which allows it to expand. This has the effect of cooling whatever container you're holding (if you've ever used a computer keyboard cleaner, you've felt this). As the gas expands, it gains kinetic energy, taking it from the exterior, thereby cooling the exterior. A propellant such as CO2 isn't necessarily toxic on its own, but many abuse it—I've seen a few people sit and snort a bottle of keyboard cleaner (before they introduced the bitterant compound). Of course this is toxic: you lose oxygen, your brain gets dazed, and you get a mild high. OK, so looking back at the answer I see it is somewhat long-winded, but there was a reason for that. ALL air fresheners are toxic to some degree. If you use them as directed, and make sure to have plenty of ventilation, you are not at risk of developing cancer or anything like that. However, should you lock yourself in the bathroom and spray off an entire bottle, you may well find yourself passing out and in serious trouble. I hope this helps![1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olf...[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olf..., http://ajrcmb.atsjournals.org/cg...[3] http://www.accepta.com/specialit...[4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car...  Embed QuoteVia  Anonymous."

Chemicals included acetone, the active ingredient in paint thinner and nail-polish remover; chloromethane, a neurotoxicant and respiratory toxicant; and acetaldehyde and 1,4-dioxane, both carcinogens. A plug-in air freshener contained more than 20 different volatile organic compounds, with more than one-third classified as toxic or hazardous under federal laws. Even air fresheners called ""organic,"" ""green,"" or with ""essential oils"" emitted hazardous chemicals, including carcinogens.In 2009, Stanley M. Caress of the University of West Georgia and Anne C. Steinemann of the University of Washington published results from two national epidemiological studies of health effects from exposure to air fresheners. They found that nearly 20 percent of the general population and 34 percent of asthmatics report headaches, breathing difficulties, or other health problems when exposed to air fresheners or deodorizers.[9]Also see http://healthinmotion.wordpress.... and http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele...Given that such research was quite recent, we don't even know the toxicity of many of the untested ones.So what are some alternatives?Removing the source of an unpleasant odor will decrease the chance that you will smell it. Ventilation is also important to maintaining indoor air quality and can aid in eliminating unpleasant odors. Simple cleaners such as white vinegar and baking soda, as well as adsorbents like zeolite, are effective at removing odors. Some house plants may also aid in the removal of toxic substances from the air in building interiors.[10][11]Maybe. Some websites say that a good solution is to put baking soda on the carpet and then to vacuum it up.

For example, caddisfly larvae in an uninfected area of a pond won't fight hard to take over the areas held by larvae in an infected part, even if they can easily survive under high toxicities. In terrestrial insects, they may avoid chewing on plants containing too high levels of heavy metals, or going to carcasses with too high concentrations (although there are specialists for all cases).This is all to avoid the stress caused by the heavy metals. Even if they have resistance, that resistance usually comes at a cost (e.g. producing more metal-binding proteins), and it's pointless to needlessly burden oneself with such things.  Embed QuoteVia  Alex K.

No long term testing has taken place, yet nanoparticles are used in a staggering number of products from beer production, cosmetics, scratch-proof glasses, batteries to popular stain-repellent khaki pants.  Nanoparticles pass through living cells rather easily and can accumulate in the body in a number of locations.In the landmark paper ""Oral exposure to polystyrene nanoparticles affects iron absorption"" published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology by lead researchers Gretchen Mahler, assistant professor of bioengineering at Binghamton University and Michael L. Shuler, the James and Marsha McCormick Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering as well as the Samuel Eckert Professor of Chemical Engineering in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University.Abstract:The use of engineered nanoparticles in food and pharmaceuticals is expected to increase, but the impact of chronic oral exposure to nanoparticles on human health remains unknown. Here, we show that chronic and acute oral exposure to polystyrene nanoparticles can influence iron uptake and iron transport in an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelium and an in vivo chicken intestinal loop model. Intestinal cells that are exposed to high doses of nanoparticles showed increased iron transport due to nanoparticle disruption of the cell membrane. Chickens acutely exposed to carboxylated particles (50 nm in diameter) had a lower iron absorption than unexposed or chronically exposed birds. Chronic exposure caused remodelling of the intestinal villi, which increased the surface area available for iron absorption. The agreement between the in vitro and in vivo results suggests that our in vitro intestinal epithelium model is potentially useful for toxicology studies.http://www.nature.com/nnano/jour...Scanning electron microscope image of polystyrene nanoparticles, roughly 100 nanometers in diameter, which are readily detected with the analyzer. In an interview with Physorg, Professor Mahler stated:""We thought that the best way to measure the more subtle effects of this kind of intake was to monitor the reaction of intestinal cells. And we did this in two ways – in vitro, through human intestinal-lining cells that we had cultured in the lab; and in vivo, through the intestinal linings of live chickens. Both sets of results pointed to the same thing – that exposure to nanoparticles influences the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.  What we found was that for brief exposures, iron absorption dropped by about 50 percent. But when we extended that period of time, absorption actually increased by about 200 percent. It was very clear – nanoparticles definitely affects iron uptake and transport.""http://www.physorg.com/news/2012...There is absolutely no doubt that nanoparticles have a tremendous value and some remarkable use cases.  In fact there are very novel studies using nanoparticles as a cancer protocol. However the proverbial genie is out of the bottle and with absolutely no restrictions or oversight on who is producing nanoparticles and in what quantities and with no safety protocols we are all facing a very dangerous impact to human health.  Embed QuoteAnswered in three minutes."

The amounts of synthetic pesticide residues in plant foods, for example, are extremely low compared to the amounts of natural “pesticides” produced by plants themselves (Ames et al., 1990a; Ames et al., 1990b; Gold et al., 1999; Gold et al., 1997b; Gold and Zeiger, 1997). Of all dietary pesticides that humans eat, 99.99% are natural: these are chemicals produced by plants to defend themselves against fungi, insects, and other animal predators (Ames et al., 1990a; Ames et al., 1990b). Each plant produces a different array of such chemicals. On average, the Western diet includes roughly 5,000 to 10,000 different natural pesticides and their breakdown products. Americans eat about 1,500 mg of natural pesticides per person per day, which is about 10,000 times more than they consume of synthetic pesticide residues (Ames et al., 1990b). Even though only a small proportion of natural pesticides has been tested for carcinogenicity, half of those tested (38/72) are rodent carcinogens; naturally occurring pesticides that are rodent carcinogens are ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices (Gold et al., 1997b; Gold et al., 1992) (Table 2).Cooking of foods produces burnt material (about 2,000 mg per person per day) that contains many rodent carcinogens. In contrast, the residues of 200 synthetic chemicals measured by United States Federal Drug Administration, including the synthetic pesticides thought to be of greatest importance, average only about 0.09 mg per person per day (Ames et al., 1990a; Gold et al., 1997b; Gold et al., 1992). In a single cup of coffee, the natural chemicals that are rodent carcinogens are about equal in weight to an entire year’s worth of synthetic pesticide residues that are rodent carcinogens, even though only 3% of the natural chemicals in roasted coffee have been adequately tested for carcinogenicity (Gold et al., 1992) (Table 3). This does not mean that coffee or natural pesticides are a cancer risk for humans, but rather that assumptions about high-dose animal cancer tests for assessing human risk at low doses need reexamination. No diet can be free of natural chemicals that are rodent carcinogens (Gold et al., 1999; Gold et al., 1997b; Gold and Zeiger, 1997)  Embed QuoteAnswered in thirty-one minutes via  Anonymous."

People in the United States receive an average of 360 mrem of radiation per year from natural and man-made radiation sources, which includes cosmic radiation exposure during commercial flights.

The latter effect actually might be more important given that commercial airplanes are struck by lightning an average of 1-2 times a year. Which could be significant for airline pilots. It also may depend on whether or not you're flying at high latitudes (which are exposed to more solar radiation). http://terra2.spacenvironment.ne... shows that high-latitude flight exposes you to around 1.5X-2.5X the amount of radiation at low altitude flight most of the time, but during solar storms, the ratio actually can drastically increase at high latitudes.http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele... shows no DNA damage (in mice) from consistent long-term exposure to radiation at levels 400 times greater than background levels. Most flights will expose you to levels 18 times higher than background levels of radiation (on a uSv/second basis), which probably pose little risk. So if you're not flying during a solar storm and at high latitudes at the same time OR you're not unlucky enough to fly next to a lightning charge or gamma-ray flash, it appears that the levels are mostly safe (see Radiation: What are some radiation exposure rates (in radiation units per second) of various activities, and how do they compare with the radiation exposure rate connected with a higher risk of cancer?). Even then, flying in the middle of a solar storm might not expose you to unsafe amounts of radiation. http://www.intechopen.com/downlo... shows that (during a solar flare) maximum radiation exposure levels were less than 400 times greater than background levels.Also, keep in mind that not all cosmic radiation is the same, and some radiation is significantly more high-energy than other radiation.==There does seem to be an apparent increased risk of cancer in flight attendants and pilots, but right now, we're unsure whether this is due to radiation (either from cosmic rays or from terrestrial lightning/gamma ray flashes) or to their stressful lifestyles (with all the jet lag). One possible factor: if your occupation involves frequent flying, then your chances of being exposed to at least one such solar storm (or lightning discharge/gamma ray discharge event) can drastically increase.For some more resources about that:http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeron...http://www.dailymail.co.uk/healt...http://ashsd.afacwa.org/docs/rad...Stewardesses could be up to five times more likely to contract breast cancer.And cabin crew of both sexes are three times more likely to suffer the deadliest form of skin cancer.Four studies published today add weight to the warning that greater exposure to cosmic radiation could be the cause of the higher rates.http://aflen2008.wordpress.com/2...After a review of 20 relevant epidemiological investigations, Ott and Huber (2006) reported that crew members and frequent flyers may be at higher risk of developing cancers of the skin (e.g., malignant melanoma, basalioma, etc.),prostate cancer, or leukemia.Do note, however, that the vast majority of the studies above seem to be done on Scandinavian and Canadian flyers, who may be exposed to more radiation than other flyers, since more cosmic radiation does tend to fall into the high latitudes due to the nature of Earth's magnetic field, and in particular, they are more likely to fly at high latitudes during a solar storm, which is the riskiest combo by all (the nature of Earth's geomagnetic field is such that solar storms increase radiation flux the most at high latitudes.) But - as the study below shows - the latitude at which people fly might actually not be so relevant.After all, flying near a lightning discharge can *significantly* increase your dose of radiation in a one-hit event. See http://news.ufl.edu/2009/12/07/l...Scientists at the Florida Institute of Technology, University of California, Santa Cruz and the University of Florida have estimated that airplane passengers could be exposed to a radiation dose equal to that from 400 chest X-rays if their airplane happens to  be near the start of a lightning discharge or related phenomena known as  a terrestrial gamma ray flash.Since each commercial airplane is hit by lightning by an average of once per year, this could potentially significantly increase the radiation dose experienced by airline pilots, frequent fliers, or people who are simply unlucky.==Things could actually change in the next 50 years, as http://news.sciencemag.org/scien... showsIf you thought the outlook for Earth's climate looked bleak, don't look up. A new study suggests that space weather—the hail of energetic particles above our atmosphere—is set to worsen in coming decades. The grim forecast suggests that astronauts and frequent flyers will face greater radiation hazards and could rule out a crewed mission to Mars before 2050.Lockwood's group found that in times of low solar activity, there seem to have been more GRCs reaching Earth. This wasn't too surprising: low activity means the solar system's shield—the heliosphere—would have been weaker. The researchers also found that low solar activity seemed to bring fewer SEP events. But to their surprise, there was a caveat: Although fewer, the SEP events appeared to be far more intense. The worst time for SEPs appeared to be at times of ""middling"" solar activity—precisely the transition period we are thought to be entering. The results were published last month in Geophysical Research Letters.How dangerous is this? One problem could arise for frequent flyers, because the thin air at high altitudes offers less protection from space weather. Currently, someone could take up to five long-haul flights every year that go near the poles—where GRCs and SEPs are channeled most—without exceeding the recommended limit on radiation exposure. But in coming decades, Lockwood explains, that safe number could drop to two.

It is wrong to compare internal emitters with external emitters, ie, ingesting radioactive isotopes versus in-flight exposure or background radiation. It is like comparing warming oneself near a fire versus eating a red hot coal.  Physicians for Social Responsibility in the United States recently issued a statement asserting “there is no safe level of radionuclide exposure, whether from food, water or other sources. Period.”  There are a number of different types of radiation, including cosmic radiation from space, terrestrial radiation which is emitted by radioactive elements in the ground, and man-made radiation such as that released by the detonation of an atomic bomb or by nuclear reactors in meltdown.Essential DifferenceFurther to the ATCA briefing, ""San Francisco Rainwater: Radiation 181 Times Above US Drinking Water Standard"" many have pointed out that the University of California at Berkeley ""Rainwater Sampling"" chart shows even at the peak finding of 20.1 Becquerels per litre, someone would have to consume 134 litres of that water in order to have the same exposure to radiation as they would receive by taking a flight from San Francisco to Washington, DC.  With respect, we consider this comparison to be utterly misleading.  Why? If living beings are exposed to radioactivity indirectly versus if they ingest something radioactive, the total effect is remarkably different.  Radiation and contamination are not the same thing! Taking a flight will expose one to cosmic radiation not radioactive contamination. When radioactive isotopes enter into water, crops, milk that leads to radioactive contamination.  Contamination occurs when material that contains radioactive isotopes is no longer contained. It is important to remember that radiation cannot spread or get ""in"" or ""on"" people; rather it is radioactive contamination that can do precisely that.  Here lies the essential difference between the two. ATCA: http://www.businessinsider.com/s...UC Berkeley: http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/Rain...Radioactive ContaminationIt is important to note that exposure to radiation -- like standing in front of a microwave oven where the seal has been damaged or an X-Ray machine -- does not result in direct contamination of any living being, because they become contaminated only through direct contact with radioactive isotopes or by being in areas where the contaminated material is already present.  Radioactive contamination and radiation exposure occur only if radioactive materials are released into the environment as the direct result of a nuclear accident, an event in nature -- such as ground radiation with radioactive isotopes -- or an act of war involving nuclear devices or radioactive isotopes. Such a release may expose living beings and contaminate their surroundings and their environment.  Radioactive contamination occurs when radioactive material is deposited on or in an object or a living being. Radioactive materials released into the environment can cause air, water, surfaces, soil, plants, buildings, people or animals to become contaminated. A contaminated living being has radioactive materials on or inside their body.Ionising RadiationIf humans ingest radioactive elements, those ""hot coals"" stay with us. Particularly nasty radioactive elements include radioactive iodine. Radioactive iodine is also readily absorbed by the body and becomes incorporated within it, and is therefore difficult to eliminate from the body. The radiation it emits can cause cancer over a period of time.  Fast moving photons (gamma rays), electrons (beta rays) and helium nuclei (alpha particles) can crash into other molecules and change their structure.  Beta particles may ionise molecules they hit, damaging DNA in cells, and disrupting their normal activities.  If this happens to a DNA molecule, the damage is caused to the genetic information, and this may turn the cell cancerous.  Ionising radiation has the power to break molecular bonds in living tissue causing damage, even in small doses, it can cause cancer in humans and other living beings.  If a lot of radioisotopes are ingested, the result would be radiation sickness and possibly death.Properties of RadioisotopesChemical properties of radioisotopes are extremely important when determining the effect that a specific radioisotope will cause. Chemical properties determine the rates of absorption, rates of metabolism and even where the isotope will be deposited. Radiation exposure potential is also determined by the type of emission from the radionuclide. Emissions that are not very penetrating while not externally a hazard become a very serious hazard when incorporated into the living body.  Alpha and beta radiation will not penetrate even a few layers of skin; however, if a radioisotope that emits alpha or beta radiation is absorbed into the body and deposited in or near radio-sensitive cells, alpha or beta particles do not have to travel very far to damage the body's cells permanently.  ConclusionA living being exposed to radiation is not necessarily contaminated with radioactive material. A living being who has been exposed to radiation has had radioactive waves or particles penetrate the body, like having an X-ray or going on a long flight. For a living being to be contaminated, radioactive material must be on or inside of their body. A contaminated living being is exposed to radiation released by the radioactive material on or inside their body. An uncontaminated living being can be exposed to radiation by being too close to radioactive isotopes or another contaminated living being, place or object.[STOPS]",""" 20.1 Becquerels per litre""aka 2 banannas (conservatively).  Kidding aside, there are so many variables that it is extremely hard to quantify in layman's terms.  There is radiation type (alpha, beta, gamma, neutron), energy (constitutes calculated absorption values), metabolic variables, etc to consider for each type of contamination.  In the case of the contaminated water, I'd be more concerned with what isotope it is contaminated with.  In the Berkeley article, Iodine 131 was the 20.1 Bd/L measured isotope.  This is higher than many safety limits and is a concern.  Embed Quote"

Apart from a “background” concentration of SF6 below 10 ppt (Geller et al., 1997), which was below our detection limit, we were aware of no additional sources of SF6 other than our injection of the tracer gas in the tailpipe. Therefore, these results show that the bus's exhaust was able to reach the sampling line located at the front (outside) of the bus, for example, when the bus was idling (e.g., at a red light or a bus stop) and the wind was blowing from the rear to the front of the bus.The results presented in Fig. 3 show there were no significant differences between measurements at the front of the cabin, at the rear of the cabin, and outside the bus when the windows were partially opened. This results from greater mixing and higher ventilation rates inside the bus when the windows were partially opened, as shown by ventilation rate measurements we conducted for each bus as a function of speed and window position ( Fitz et al., 2003).  Embed Quote"

Or is something else entirely going on there?,"A regrettable coincidence (or is it?). Poison oak imitates the leaves of the blackberry? And according to online sources it is true they often grow together. I wouldn't think blackberry benefits from this because the plant's reliant on foragers who snack on its berries... if I am correct... Oak is the opportunistic partner in this common scenario. Also, both poison oak and blackberry tend to overgrow clearcut areas (for instance under powerlines where it is sprayed heavily with herbicides). Both plants are helping to regrow the forests by curing and nurturing the soil and protecting young saplings.  Embed Quote"

Lead is truly truly nasty stuff due to its chronic and insidious neurological effects. I'm less concerned about EPA guidelines for chemicals whose effects are more acute and less neurological.Even low levels of lead can lead to long-term damage in IQ. The effects are obviously stronger in children, but given the stark magnitude of the effects at such low exposures, I wouldn't even want to expose myself to any of the stuff even when no longer a child.See Intellectual Impairment in Children with Blood Lead Concentrations below 10 μg per Deciliter — NEJMThe findings of this study are startling and counter-intuitive: at lower concentrations of lead in the blood – below 10 µg/dL - children tested for IQ at ages three and five, showed a greater decline in IQ for a rise in blood lead from 1 to 10 µg/dL, than those whose blood lead level went from 10 to 20 µg/dL.“The blood lead concentration was inversely and significantly associated with IQ. In the linear model, each increase of 10 µg per deciliter in the lifetime average blood lead concentration was associated with a 4.6-point decrease in IQ (P=0.004), whereas for the subsample of 101 children whose maximal lead concentrations remained below 10 µg per deciliter, the change in IQ associated with a given change in lead concentration was greater. When estimated in a nonlinear model with the full sample, IQ declined by 7.4 points as lifetime average blood lead concentrations increased from 1 to 10 µg per deciliter.”Also Lead Poisoning: The Ignored ScandalAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, parents should be concerned if their children’s blood lead concentration exceeds five micrograms per deciliter, but studies have found that even infinitesimally low levels—down to one or two micrograms per deciliter—can reduce a child’s IQ and impair her self-control and ability to organize thoughts.I once got my blood lead levels checked and I had levels of 1 ug/dL. Average in the U.S. is 2 ug/dL. I'd say that getting a blood test for lead is probably a good idea. If it's at 1 or 2 ug/dL, I wouldn't worry too much (inasmuch as it would be difficult to get it lower). Anything higher though, and you'd never know what shit it could do to your brain.  Embed Quote"

How severe must lead exposure be to cause concern for an adult?","Most people with clinically relevant lead intoxication are:-children chewing off lead containing paints on their toys or other things at home-grown-ups who during their work are very much exposed to lead, e.g. working in battery producing factories, cutting metals coated with lead containing paints e.g. old bridges/constructions/ships during which one's face is very much near the cutting/burning point so inhalating lead vapors.  In The Netherlands we don't see this in white Dutch workers, but a lot in North African e.g. Moroccan workers due to differences in the way the hold their heads relative to the flame during this operation.-people getting their drinking water through lead lined pipes (almost all replaced now in the developed world).So I wouldn't worry too much, as long as you don't have any new complains.However, if you have belly complains, have psychological problems, anemia, have your doc check your blood lead levels.  Lead intoxication can be treated e.g. by infusing chelation therapy with the combination of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL) and edathamil calcium disodium (CaEDTA).From Elsevier  Perspective on lead toxicity, a comparison between the United States and Iran by Ali Pourmand, Tareq Khedir Al-tiae and Maryann Mazer-AmirshahiSignificant lead toxicity is noted with BLLs of greater than 70 μg/dL in children and 100 μg/dL in adults. Patients with moderate lead toxicity (BLL 50 to 70 μg/dL in children, 70 to 100 μg/dL in adults) can also have altered mental status, gastrointestinal distress, and hematologic abnormalities. Peripheral neuropathy and nephropathy occurs more commonly in adults. In children, “asymptomatic” lead exposure generally associated with BLLs less than 49 μg/dL can lead to impaired cognitive, behavioral and motor development. In adults, low level lead exposure can result in subtle cognitive effects, hypertension, nephropathy, and impaired fertility http://...[1].                There is mounting evidence that even low-level lead exposure can have significant health effects, especially in susceptible populations such as children and there are multiple studies in the US and Iran showing clinical repercussions even with previously accepted BLLs of 10 μg/dL.BLL = blood lead level.  Embed QuoteVia  Raman Shah."

(the key thing here is that most CNS neurons don't reproduce. But there are several distinct mechanisms of neurotoxicity. For example - the axons can be damaged, and it's a very open question whether or not axon damage is permanent or not. On the other hand, loss of the neuronal cell itself is possibly permanent, except possibly in the Hippocampus [but even then, H.M. could not regenerate his hippocampal neurons])This article (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/2...) shows that we might eventually be able to predict which genes (and proteins) could actually help protect against man-made environmental toxins. Then we can try a microarray analysis to see which genes are expressed more in the animals that have mutated receptors that have protected against new toxins.Today, scientists can scan the entire genomes of New York’s animals and plants to look for evolutionary changes. Last month, Mr. Harris presented new data on white-footed mice at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Evolution. Mr. Harris and his colleagues have identified mutations in more than 1,000 genes that are present in all New York City mice, but missing from mice in Harriman State Park, 45 miles north of the city.The scientists are investigating whether these mutations have helped the mice adapt to life in New York City. Clues that some of them do are found in the functions of the mutated genes. Many of the genes are involved in fighting bacteria, while others are for reproduction and still others for coping with stress from exposure to chemicals. It’s possible that these new mutations are spreading independently in each of the parks in the city.“The idea is that the urban pressures are the same everywhere, and they’re all adapting,” said Mr. Harris.Cities attract only a small fraction of evolutionary biologists, who often work in lusher places like the Amazon. But urban evolution is attracting more research these days, because cities are fast-growing, and the urban environment is quickly taking over large areas of the Earth’s surface.==Top toxicology journal: http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/Is there a database of all possible receptors that a drug (or molecule) can react with? => http://www.bindingdb.org/bind/in...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tem... => Wikipedia template on toxins, lots of resources in each of the individual subcategorieshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tem... => Wikipedia toxicology templatehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tem...http://books.google.com/books?id... => Principles of Biochemical Toxicologyhttp://ctd.mdibl.org/query.go?ty... =>Chemical–Gene Interaction Query - CTDhttp://www.pharmgkb.org/ => The Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base [PharmGKB]http://potency.berkeley.edu/ => The Carcinogenic Potency Project (CPDB)http://www.reactome.org/Reactome...http://ctd.mdibl.org/ => The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database - CTDhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tox...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyt... => Cytochrome P450: Understand this well.

However, it should be noted that ""natural"" mercury emissions are accounted as including re-emission of both anthropogenic and ""natural"" deposits, and that re-emission of previously anthropogenically-attributable mercury has been estimated to account for 50% of all ""natural"" land and ocean emissions into the atmosphere (Lindberg et al. 2007, pg. 20). So, mercury vapor entering the atmosphere from an open field would be counted as a ""natural"" emission, even if that mercury had been deposited in that field as a result of a nearby coal-fired power plant.Mercury cycles through the environment, so the question of where the mercury found in fish comes from depends on how many steps back you go. The short version is that mercury in fish comes from what they eat, including plants, crustaceans, and other fish. Mercury bioaccumulates up the food chain, which is why top predatory fish have higher concentrations than those at the bottom of the food chain. The mercury bioaccumulating up the food chain (and the one of major concern to human health) is methylmercury (MeHg), which has been converted from inorganic mercury by bacteria living at the sedimentary level. This methylmercury is then taken up by the marine food web, and also explains why bottom-dwelling animals tend to have higher mercury concentrations than you would otherwise expect.The mercury in sediment has settled from the water. Mercury enters the water from atmospheric and terrestrial deposition. There is run-off from surface deposits, direct dumping, settling of mercury-laden atmospheric particulates, mercury-laden rain, etc. A 2002 paper by Mason and Shau (see bottom of comment reference) estimated that atmospheric deposition into the oceans accounted for around 15.4 times that of surface deposition.According to a 2010 estimate by Pirrone et al., annual ""natural"" emissions to the atmosphere (including re-emission of anthropogenic emissions) totalled 5207 megagrams (5,207,000 kilograms), while annual anthropogenic emissions totalled 2320 megagrams (2,320,000 kilograms). The study found that ""fossil-fuel fired power plants, ferrous and non-ferrous metals manufacturing facilities, caustic soda production plants, ore processing facilities, incinerators for urban, medical and industrial wastes, cement plants and chemicals production facilities"" released significant amounts of mercury into the atmosphere, and that ""fossil fuel-fired power plants are the largest point sources of mercury released to the atmosphere"" (Pirrone et al. 2010, pg. 4726). It's also important to note that mercury concentrations are higher near their source, so fish living in an area close to coal-fired power plants are likely to have higher concentrations than those that are not. Deposits in sediment and elsewhere may also endure for a long time, so closure of a plant or other point source may not reduce risk for years or decades. My doctoral thesis, Fish Consumption, Mercury Intake, and the Associated Risks to the Kuwaiti Population, considers the past presence of a nearby chlorine and bleach processing plant that had used mercury cathodes as a possible contributor to mercury concentrations in fish in the Arabian Gulf, though the plant closed in the 1970s.I'll have a look for historical databases on mercury concentrations in fish and let you know if something comes up.

Logue, 32, an air quality engineer at the Berkeley Lab. “When you live in a small building, you cook a lot and don’t use your range hood, which may not be very effective anyway, then you’re probably going to have a problem with pollutants from cooking.”Recently Dr. Logue estimated the long-term health effects expected from hundreds of chemicals found in average homes. Her 2012 study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, used a common epidemiological metric known as disability-adjusted life-year to show that the population-wide health impact of indoor pollutants is on a par with that of car accidents, and greater than that of traditional concerns like secondhand smoke or radon.When they tested seven different commercially available range hood designs, Dr. Singer and Dr. Delp found that the airflow and the amount of burner exhaust and cooking contaminants whisked away — the so-called “capture efficiency” — varied from 15 percent to 98 percent. [1]There is also acrolein which is emitted when meats and oils are cooked and ""is a genotoxic tissue irritant and was used as a nerve agent in World War I.""[2]There's a good comment below from a restaurant equipment technician who says that:A larger issue with older (especially dirty) ranges is that the venturi and air shutters become clogged with dust and grease. This can easily lead to incomplete combustion of your fuel gas. This results in very high levels of carbon monoxide in the exhaust gases.The technician offers tips as well:With the burner lit look at the flame... it SHOULD be blue and tight... if there is any yellow/orange at the flame tip/body (not sparkles... that's just dust) then the flame is o2 starved and is producing CO... AMONG OTHER NASTIESBased on this, it may make sense to open a window when cooking — or use other techniques to improve ventilation. Doing so may be beneficial for your health — provided it's not too hot or cold outside and there isn't some other compelling reason to keep your window closed.[1] The Kitchen as a Pollution Hazard [2] Hidden Dangers in the Air We Breathe  Embed Quote"

This event came so quickly that pilots probably wouldn't be able to descend lower into the atmosphere after hearing of it.This seems to be the only recent event above the 0.03044 uSv/second threshold though, and only a small fraction of pilots were probably flying over high latitudes that time... Plus, flares like this are generally pretty rare (how many pilots would be exposed to several of these events while flying at high latitudes in their lifetime?But...Flying near a lightning discharge can *significantly* increase  your dose of radiation in a one-hit event. See http://news.ufl.edu/2009/12/07/l...Scientists  at the Florida Institute of Technology, University of California, Santa  Cruz and the University of Florida have estimated that airplane  passengers could be exposed to a radiation  dose equal to that from 400  chest X-rays if their airplane happens to  be near the start of a  lightning discharge or related phenomena known as  a terrestrial gamma  ray flash.Since each  commercial airplane is hit by lightning by an average of once per year,  this could potentially significantly increase the radiation dose  experienced by airline pilots, frequent fliers, or people who are simply  unlucky.====[1] And when does a danger level start to pop in? Well, let's try with some levels where there doesn't seem to be danger yet (see http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/artic...)Info from the study:DNA damage occurs spontaneously even at background radiation levels,  conservatively at a rate of about 10,000 changes per cell per day. Most  of that damage is fixed by DNA repair systems within each cell. The  researchers estimate that the amount of radiation used in this study  produces an additional dozen lesions per cell per day, all of which  appear to have been repaired.Though the study ended after five  weeks, Engelward believes the results would be the same for longer  exposures. “My take on this is that this amount of radiation is not  creating very many lesions to begin with, and you already have good DNA  repair systems. My guess is that you could probably leave the mice there  indefinitely and the damage wouldn’t be significant,” she says. ===1 gray is approximately equal to 1 Sievert for x-rays and gamma rays, but 20 Sieverts for alpha particles0.00017 cGy/min (or 0.0283 uGy/second) from I-125 irradiator (400X higher than background radiation, 5x higher than some sites at Iran) at cumulative dose of 10.5 cGy over 5 weeks => no effects on DNASupposedly, the majority of background radiation tracks through our bodies are photon tracks.7.1 cGy/min at cumulative dose of 10.5 cGy significantly upregulates Cdkn1a but does not lead to statistically significant detectable increase in homologous recombination.  Embed QuoteAnswered in fifteen minutes."

Once you mix just about anything with a billion gallons of water in the nearby river it doesn't really amount to much. (Of course, that's a terrible mindset to have most of the time! Even if it is true in this case.) Most liquid drain cleaners are pretty safe for the environment once they're washed away and diluted. They're basically just a concentrated mixture of bleach and lye. That's NaClO (sodium hypochlorite) and NaOH/KOH (sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide). It is a powerful base and very corrosive but gets progressively milder as water is added until eventually it becomes perfectly safe to drink. When used as intended, a significant amount will react with grease and hair and other drain gunk and simply be neutralized. Long story short, if you pour a gallon of it on the ground or in a creek you could do a small amount of damage. It would definitely burn you very badly if you drank it. But washed through sewage and a treatment plant and into a river, it's perfectly harmless.   Embed Quote"

I think prenatal pesticide exposure is something that is really overlooked (the number of impacted individuals is unknown though),"PBDEs: http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele...Pesticides (especially since developing countries tend to use the more dangerous organochlorides and organophosphates).See http://e360.yale.edu/feature/fro...The New York studies found that for every increased increment of prenatal organophosphate pesticide exposure, the IQs of the children studied dropped by 1.4 percent and their working memory scores dropped by 2.8 percent. A key finding of the Columbia University study was that the relationship between pesticide exposure and IQ and working memory scores was linear and showed “no evidence for a threshold.” In other words, the greater the exposure, the greater the impact on cognition.The third study, led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, looked at 329 children living in agricultural communities in the Salinas Valley, in Monterey County, the country’s top vegetable-producing region. The California mothers were predominantly Latino farmworkers, and their exposure resulted from living and working near where these chemicals were used agriculturally; when sprayed on crops, organophosphate pesticides can easily drift with the wind beyond their intended fields.As with the New York study, when researchers measured the IQ of the California children at age seven, those with the highest prenatal exposure scored as much as 7 points lower than the children with the lowest prenatal levels of pesticide exposure.Furthermore, this is just in the U.S., where there are regulations on pesticide use (and where the climate is fairly temperate - freezing periods can really help control pests). The scenario is most likely worse in developing countries.The sad thing is that I tried some aggressive Google-searching for pesticides+""developing countries""+IQ and could find nothing. The article above was written in 2011, so we're really only just starting to discover the nasty effects of pesticides on IQAlso, those in developing nations are often vulnerable to infectious illnesses (http://www.scientificamerican.co... ) that can lower IQ. But the chemicals used to control them (especially ones like DDT) can also decrease IQ. It's possible that these chemicals could reduce the incidence of IQ-lowering infectious diseases for a while, but infectious agents often develop pesticide resistance, which can then produce a double-whammy effect (with the IQ-lowering effects of both infectious illnesses and pesticides)The other thing with developing nations is that most people are younger in them, so a disproportionate of them are now getting exposed by pesticides during the most critical parts of their lives.Anyways - I may sound too much like an environmentalist here, but Alex K. Chen's answer to Ecology: Would any ecosystems or the food chain be drastically affected if mosquitoes became extinct suddenly? should show that I really do look from the other side of the issue as well.(With that all being said, these environmental contributions probably don't explain much of the recorded variance in IQ between countries - as most ""country-wide IQ"" scores were made several decades ago - when it was the industrialized nations that applied a disproportionate amount of the neurotoxic pesticides. But they could stall out the Flynn Effect for some time).===Also, air pollution (http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele... )Prenatal exposure to environmental pollutants known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can adversely affect a child's intelligence quotient or IQ, according to new research by the the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) at the Mailman School of Public Health. PAHs are chemicals released into the air from the burning of coal, diesel, oil and gas, or other organic substances such as tobacco. In urban areas motor vehicles are a major source of PAHs.The study found that children exposed to high levels of PAHs in New York City had full scale and verbal IQ scores that were 4.31 and 4.67 points lower, respectively than those of less exposed children. High PAH levels were defined as above the median of 2.26 nanograms per cubic meter (ng/m3).  Embed Quote"

A catalytic converter will not do anything about tank emissions. This is why gas pumps in cities have those weird little ""vapor recovery"" bellows on them, and why modern vehicles have sealed fuel systems. It keeps the vapors inside your tank where they belong.

They found that several different types of commonly used filter materials effectively block the passage of silver particles 3 to 20 nm in diameter. In fact, the filters proved to be better at blocking the very smallest particles than they were at filtering particles in the 100-nm range.There are, however, studies that suggest the filters are less effective for other nanoparticles. Sergey Grinshpun, a professor of environmental health at the University of Cincinnati, tested two types of N95 respirators, which are supposed to filter out 95% of the particles they encounter, under two different inhalation flow rates. He found that under certain conditions up to 7% of sodium chloride particles in the 30- to 70-nm range were getting through the respirators.""Not all the respirators that are certified to be 95 provide 95% efficiency for all nanoparticles,"" Grinshpun concludes. Respirator filters are typically tested against 300-nm particles, a size that NIOSH determined years ago to be the most penetrating. But those tests, he explains, were based on data from uncharged filter material. Since then, respirator makers have shifted to using charged filter material.

I'm not convinced either way yet, but both sides have a case.As for cell phone towers and cancer risk (not cell phones specifically,but stll relevant as these are the same frequencies), see intense discussion at http://www.reddit.com/r/science/...In particular, see http://www.reddit.com/r/science/...32.1 to 43.4 is a 35% increase in risk which is NOT good.The 95% confidence interval on the mortality rate is quite tight due to large numbers of observed deaths. Additionally there is an obvious progression linked with distance which would appear to refute your appeal to error.Table 5.

I understand that with what the article claims, but not the paper. They are attempting to reject the hypothesis that there is no significant difference, which is rejected because there is a significant difference.Yes, there will be some overlap on factors here, but it's really not enough to out of hand dismiss the claims. You can see the distribution of both deaths and base stations on pages 10 and 11, and granted I cannot go through the analysis they did, but it does not look like density clumping is the issue. You see that again on page 15, with it approaching norms as you get farther from base towers. I can think of a few confounding factors too, but such is the case with most studies. Again, they are attempting to reject the null hypothesis, and they do.Finally, this is not the first paper to find such correlations. I would be curious if anyone has papers that do not show a correlation, or shows a regression fully explaining such a correlation. Those that do attempt to seem to be hitting on a strawman, self reported complaints, rather than robust data driven studies.What I do find interesting is how much immediate rejection there is to such a paper. It's very emotionally reactive, which is kind of odd. The same goes with figuring out the interaction - well, that's the point. If a correlation is consistently found (null hypothesis is not rejected would be the interesting parts now), it points to trying to find out what the issue is.Keep in mind that the advice they give is related to the inverse square rule, and apparently they have significantly more power being pushed in this region. Hopefully they picked the area based on that. Anyway, the answer could be as simple as having more towers with less power. That could be another large (maybe meta - not sure how many papers have come out already) test, actually, to compare cities with different strengths. shrug  Embed QuoteAnswered in twenty-two minutes."

Sources of electric and magnetic field exposures may be occupational or residential and include proximity to certain types of electrical equipment, transmission and distribution power lines as well as appliance use. The early studies of children tended toward a consistent association between risks for leukemia and brain cancer and residential proximity to power lines having high wire configuration. More recent studies-and studies which have attempted to improve upon the measurement of exposure by using calculated fields, point-in-time or personal monitoring-have been inconsistent, with some suggesting increased risk and others not. Occupational exposures have suggested an increase in risk for leukemia, and to a lesser extent brain cancer and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, studies of residential exposures and cancer in adults generally have suggested no effect. Laboratory work has been unable to demonstrate a biological mechanism which might explain the epidemiological findings. In spite of extensive efforts over the past 20 years and many expert reviews, it has been difficult to reach consensus regarding the carcinogenic effects of electric and magnetic fields. Exposure assessment has proven to be complex, and agreement on the relevant exposure metric has not yet been obtained. There is justification to question whether point-in-time measures in homes are appropriate indices of the relevant etiological exposure, as they fail to account for changes over time, peak exposures or time-varying fields. Nevertheless, it is probably desirable to err on the side of caution in not placing too much weight on the inconsistencies. The IARC has classified EMF as a ""possible carcinogen"" which refers to the circumstances where there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and inadequate evidence in experimental animals. The IARC review indicated limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of extremely low-frequency magnetic fields in relation to childhood leukemia at high level exposure in the residential environment (average residential magnetic field strength >0.4 μT). Even higher levels of exposure in the occupational environment may increase the risk of leukemia in adults.PMID: 21199600 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]Publication Types, MeSH TermsPublication TypesReviewMeSH TermsCanada/epidemiologyCausalityElectromagnetic Fields/adverse effects*Environmental Exposure/adverse effectsEnvironmental Monitoring/standardsHumansLeukemia/epidemiology*Leukemia/etiology*Occupational Diseases/epidemiologyOccupational Diseases/etiologyRisk Assessment/methodsRisk Assessment/standards  Embed QuoteAnswered in twenty-seven minutes."

These by-products of fireworks combustion will vary depending on the mix of ingredients of a particular firework. Sources of perchlorate range from lightning and certain fertilizers to the perchlorate compounds in rocket fuel and explosives. Scientists long suspected community fireworks displays were another source, but few studies had been done on the topic.The concern over pollution from fireworks constitutes a red herring, since the amount of contamination from fireworks is minuscule in comparison to emissions from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels. Coal fueled electricity generation alone is a much greater source of heavy metal contamination in the environment than fireworks.  Embed QuoteVia  Steve Denton."

The little research I've done seems to indicate that there is little risk in individual firework displays or a series of displays over a few days (see Emission Factor abstract below]  However, the displays can adversely effect those with poor health conditions [See Recreational Factor abstract below]Another thing to think on. How much pollution is being generated already in the locale? How much do fireworks contribute to the mix? Could a firework display be used to educate folks on pollution generators in the area and the relative contributions of fireworks? (these are just thinking out loud quesitons!)You are not alone in your concerns. (We've come a long way since the 60's...I remember as a 6th grade student..we passed  about 1 tablespoon of mercury around the room to ""play with"" ...with the teacher's encouragement!).A 2007 research paper in the international peer reviewed journal ""Atmospheric Environment"" reported on the aerosol samples collected during massive fireworks displays at the 6 day event Las Fallas in Valencia, Spain.The conclusion in the abstract """"Although firework-related recreational pollution episodes are transient in nature, they are highly concentrated, contribute significantly to total annual metal emissions, and are on average fine enough to be easily inhaled and a health risk to susceptible individuals. ""[Recreational atmospheric pollution episodes: Inhalable metalliferous particles from fireworkdisplays; Atmospheric Environment; Feb2007, Vol. 41 Issue 5, p913-922, 10p]I haven't done detailed research [only a cursory search at Academic Search Premier] but there have been some studies on the effects of firework by products on human health/environment. --Emission factors and exposures from ground-level pyrotechnics.[Atmospheric Environment; Sep2010, Vol. 44 Issue 27, p3295-3303, 9p]From the abstract ""Potential exposures from ground-level pyrotechnics were assessed by air monitoring and developing emission factors. Total particulate matter, copper and SO<sub>2</sub> exposures exceeded occupational health guidelines at two outdoor performances using consumer pyrotechnics. Al, Ba, B, Bi, Mg, Sr, Zn, and aldehyde levels were elevated, but did not pose a health hazard based on occupational standards. There seems to be some trends in making less toxic fireworks..For example, the US Army is considering replacing a barium compound with a much less toxic boron compound in green colored fireworks. [The free online article Cleaner, Greener Fireworks(http://www.nature.com/news/2011/...) also discusses other variables in firework production as cost and performance. Boron seems to ""pass these tests"".So, there are good reasons to be concerned about the effects of at least some firework components. This raises good ethical questions about the responsibility of people shooting fireworks (this is a general question, Brian, not  pointing fingers at the industry!) Can only speak for myself, I know in my own daily life I don't always walk lightly on the earth...but once aware of the (at least potential) adverse effects of what I do...as being an agent of free will (sorry, what little philosophy I had is creeping in!)...I do have some responsibility on choosing what to do or not do....This isn't really a complete answer. Just the results of about 15 minutes or so of searching.I would be happy to search further. Let me know which direction.  Embed QuoteVia  Steve Denton."

These polluting particles come from all sorts of different sources. A portion of indoor air pollution is due to dead skin cells but household fabrics like those of your couches, carpets, or drapes can also breakdown and become airborne. If you have pets your indoor air quality will be even worse due to pet dander. Even things like the plastics and paints in your house give off chemicals that contribute to poor indoor air quality.Outdoor air smells ""fresher"" because even though there are many sources of pollution there is still a huge volume of air in the atmosphere and natural processes are constantly at work to bring air to a natural or ""fresh"" state.A good analogy might be to compare your indoor air to the water in your bathtub. If you were to put a bottle of food coloring into a full bathtub you would end up with a very colorful bathtub. But even a thousand gallons of food coloring in the middle of the ocean would soon dissipate and have no effect on the ocean's color.  Embed Quote"

And fixing the problem is a lot cheaper than doing nothing.","I'm no expert on this, but I've read a lot of the crime theories, and the lead theory is one of the few ones that strikes me as a plausible explanation for a wide variety of crime phenomena. That being said, I'm not completely convinced yet (I'd have to read the studies in more detail to figure out).Nonetheless, let's be clear what the hypothesis says, if true. The hypothesis doesn't say that lead is the chief or major explanation for crime rates, or even for regional or individual differences in crime rates. What it does say is that the specific temporal anomaly of crime rates rising around the 60s and falling beginning with the 90s owes most of its explanation to lead, and ceteris paribus, if lead levels fall, then crime rates would fall. It would still be true that, even after controlling for lead levels, there is considerable variation in crime rates across regions, due to a variety of other factors in operation.Also, the relevance of the finding may be relatively limited for future crime prevention in the US, if lead levels are already declining and there are diminishing returns to further declines in terms of crime rates. But it may hold important lessons for people in other parts of the world, where leaded fuels are widely used and lead levels are likely to increase as the extent of road transportation increases to cater to the needs of a growing and more prosperous population.See also Steven Pinker's remarks on the problem with drawing inferences across multi-step causal chains in the context of the lead-crime connection: http://stevenpinker.com/files/pi...  Embed Quote"

An exception to this is a Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) sensor, which tests for multiple pollutants and gives you an aggregated value/level.There are devices that test for one or a few pollutants. Most air quality monitoring devices test temperature & humidity ( combined can lead to mold ), Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide. Usually for Carbon Monoxide there are standalone devices.However, this is just the tip of the iceberg, there are lots of possible and probable pollutants: Ozone, Nitrogen oxides, Sulfur Dioxide, Radon, Lead, etc. The list goes on and on and they are not as rare as one might think/hope.For example, Radon is a radioactive gas without color or smell. Radon comes from Uranium, which is present in the soil nearly everywhere in the US. It is said to be the second leading cause for lung cancer in the US.There is a lot of information and studies on the subject of indoor air quality, although much more is needed. I myself found only limited scientific studies exist for some specific pollutants.I am fascinated by this topic and I am actually currently involved in creating a monitoring device called AirPlusPlus for common indoor air pollutants. This is just the first step of a much larger vision. Hopefully one day anyone interested can monitor, track and improve the quality of the air in their homes.  Embed Quote"

[see, e.g. 1, also 2]In the US, the Clean Air Act, originally passed in 1963 and continually revised, has been a spectacular success- it essentially gave the Public Health Service (later, the EPA) the authority to identify hazardous pollutants and regulate their emission from point sources.  The law was famously open-ended, allowing for science-based decision making and broad regulatory authority. Another success story has to do with sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants- the principal cause of acid rain.  President Bush (#1) oversaw the implementation of a cap-and-trade program  by which polluters had to purchase permits to pollute, and the number of permits gradually decreased with time.  Though the power industry argued the policy would be prohibitively expensive, in the end the costs were less than half of what was projected [3].  And how often do you hear about acid rain anymore?[1] http://www.ametsoc.org/atmospoli...[2] The Technological Egg and Regulatory Chicken[3] http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/re...  Embed Quote"

(see Can air pollutant nanoparticles cross the nasal endothelium and possibly enter the brain? ),"My answer is based on physiology, not a scientific trial. With that caveat: your nose has hair for a reason-- it acts to filter particulates. Ever go walking in a really dusty location? After you start blowing your nose, the mucous will be the color of the dust around you . Mouth Breathing let's the particles that could have been captured into your lungs which have cilia that also work to bring it up;hence the crap you cough up. Of course if you are talking really small particles, you are out of luck either way.

It worked out well for me and fits in quite well with public and environmental health. I think I was able to get a lot from 3 different fields while majoring Human Ecology. This was by design though.

Not in aerial photos, not in satellite photos.Regarding the availability of satellite imagery of the oceans: Unfortunately we haven’t found great sources of data for most of the open ocean because most imagery providers focus their efforts on the land. Where we do have satellite imagery for the ocean surface, we’ve preserved it in the most recent version of Google Earth and the satellite view in Maps. For example you can still see trawling vessels in southeast Asia. There are a number of potential applications for such imagery, from amateur interest in finding ships to looking at off-shore oil platforms to locating illegal fishing vessels, so it’s certainly worth exploring how we could track down data for the rest of the ocean.Regarding the gyre: the trash gyre presents its own set of challenges. Even if we had satellite imagery, the gyre likely wouldn’t appear in it. Most of the plastic is particulate and/or a bit under the surface so you can’t see it in the imagery. A number of groups are starting to focus on collecting more data about the gyre via expeditions and sampling – we’d love to see one or more of them produce maps that could be viewed in Google Earth.  --  Why You Can't See The Great Pacific Garbage Patch On Google Earth  Embed Quote"

But yes, there is reason for optimism and there's a few projects in development. The really fascinating one, which I learned of from watching his TedX Talk, is being spearheaded by Boyan Slat, a teenage engineering student. Yes, a teen! You can watch him give his talk (I'll embed the video at the bottom) but the gist of it is for a mesh-free system that would not disturb the fish or plant life, and would be powered by the sun and wave currents (not creating any emissions). And it could remove 7 million tons of plastic--which is certainly not all of it but is incredibly ambitious.These booms act as giant 'funnels', where an angle of the booms create a component of the surface current force in the direction of the platforms.The debris then enters the platforms, where it will be filtered out of the water, and eventually stored in containers until collected for recycling on land. Those ""processing plants"" in the pictures are computer models, of course. But there are 50 engineers working on Boyan's project! And it's possible it could be a feasible solution in the future. You can visit his site (The Ocean Cleanup - Boyan Slat) or watch his amazing talk at the bottom.  Embed Quote"

The easiest way to clean the ""garbage"" or suspended particles would be to determine the charge of the particles. They're suspended in water now because they are all of the same charge (either positive or negative) thus they repel each other and don't want to settle to the ocean floor. The plastic's density, which is less than water, is also why it's floating on the top of the water and not sinking to the bottom. Once the charge of the suspended plastics are determined, the easiest and most cost effective way to remove the particles would be to add a coagulant, or a chemical to neutralize the charge of the suspended particles. Once the charge of the plastic is neutralized, it would more than likely settle to the ocean floor in clumps, where it would be more easily removed from the water.  Embed Quote"

The plasticizer is used in a large  range of products to which people have a high exposure, such as foot wraps,  beverage containers and food wraps. ""Phthalates are horrible because they are so easily taken into our bodies.  They can be absorbed by skin contact, ingested and absorbed,"" Wang told the  audience.The two girls identified bacteria from two sites along the Fraser River with  varying concentrations of phthalates: the Richmond landfill and the Reifel bird  sanctuary.With assistance from University of B.C. professor Lindsay Eltis, they  isolated 14 different strains of bacteria, and then cultured several to feed on  a phthalate-enriched diet. They were stunned to find they could convince the  bacteria to target the chemical to the exclusion of other food sources.""This led us to conclude that our bacteria doesn't only grow in a macroscopic  culture that has phthalates as a sole carbon source, but is genetically capable  of breaking down phthalates. It actually has a genetic pathway to create enzymes  that can degrade phthalates,"" Wang said. Vancouver students take their plastic-eating bacteria ideas to the stage at TED Finally, back on the land , there have been some discoveries as well : Amazonian Rainforest Fungus Eats Polyurethane, Potentially Solving a Big Landfill Problem All said and done, this is not necessarily great news if the organisms eating bad stuff are themselves eaten by a bigger creature - especially before the bad stuff is broken down.  We will also need to be very very careful if we decide to artificially make an organism that will consume the plastics.  Embed Quote"

Since plastics break down to even smaller polymers, concentrations of submerged particles are not visible from space, nor do they appear as a continuous debris field. Instead, the patch is defined as an area in which the mass of plastic debris in the upper water column is significantly higher than average.[1]Here's  a bit more:Microplastics that make up the majority of garbage patches can’t always be seen by the naked eye. Satellite imagery of oceans doesn’t show a giant patch of garbage.The existence of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was predicted by many oceanographers and climatologists. However, the actual discovery of the patch was made by a racing boat captain, Charles Moore. Moore was sailing from Hawaii to California after competing in a yachting race. Crossing the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, Moore and his crew noticed millions of pieces of plastic surrounding his ship.Any kind of trash can get into the ocean—from glass bottles to aluminum cans to medical waste. The vast majority of marine debris, however, is plastic. Scientists have collected up to 750,000 bits of plastic in a single square kilometer (or 1.9 million bits per square mile) of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. [2]Can you see the “garbage patches” with satellite photos?NO. Relative to the expanse of the North Pacific Ocean, sightings of large concentrations of debris, especially of large debris items are not very common. A majority of the debris observed in the “garbage patch” is small plastic pieces. Small debris pieces are difficult to see due to their size, and many of these pieces may be suspended below the surface of the water, which would make them even harder to see, even with the human eye. For these reasons, the debris, or “patch” of debris is not visible with existing satellite technology.

What is the Pacific Garbage Patch?The  pacific garbage patch is as real a problem as global warming. The patch  cannot be seen from space because the plastic particles are small and this size of Texas thing is speculation. The problem however is very real. The particles are small because of the way plastic behaves when in  water. It depends on the conditions existing near the surface such as  turbidity, salinity, wind speed, and dissolved solids present.(This is to show that there is no patch, and the plastic is distributed along the ocean current routes. See Juan Videla's answer for the real picture, I did not want to add it as he had covered it already) People  believe the ocean to be a single large body, but think of the water as  having layers similar to how the atmosphere has different layers.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat...Now  the plastics float near the surface, with no decomposition or sink to  the bottom depending on what type of plastic it is made from. Due to  factors such as ocean currents and winds, these plastics become smaller  and finer particles, becoming a part of the ocean drift: http://5gyres.org/what_is_the_pr...This ultimately causes the garbage to accumulate instead of being distributed. Consider the case of the rubber duckies:http://suite101.com/article/rubb...If  28,800 duckies that float take 25 years to wash up on shores taking 3-4  round trips in the pacific, think of the amount of plastic that gets  dumped. Garbage does not float as much as the duckies mentioned above  and they break into smaller particles, implying that they may never wash  up at all. 2. What is the extent of plastic in the sea?Estimates of how much plastic ends up in the ocean is highly  varied as country/region wise data is hard to find. According to Green  Peace, it is about 10%. According to 5gyres.com , it could be as high as 30%. But given that in certain countries  recycle up to 12 - 30% of their plastic, the remaining 70% remains  unaccounted for:http://earth911.com/recycling/pl...http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/...Reality  is no reliable data exists which can validate or negate this data. 4. What can be done about it?Existing damage cleanup:This  plastic can neither be cleaned up nor decomposed in the foreseeable  future. Many projects exist, including the usage of solar powered micro-bots to gather the plastic from the surface of the sea. However the economic viability of the projects and poor funding have prevented any of them from lifting off.Cleanup on the surface:Cleanup under the surface:As I said earlier, these are proven projects with no further funding to start execution because maritime laws are such that the seas don't belong to any one country. After you cross the territorial waters, the open seas are everyones to pollute but noones responsibility to clean. This issue is not the same as airpollution which is being negotiated globally. As such no frame work or mechanism to pool in a global effort exists.Prevention:The only way go go about it is for now is prevention of plastic entering the water stream. It is not the production and use of plastics that is the problem here, but the recycling ratio and unaccounted/lost to water streams plastic that is the problem. There are several key points here:How bio-degrable is it? - anywhere from 2-15 years to break upWhat is the type of plastic used? polystyrene/polyvinyl chloride etc decide the lifecycle tooHow do you prevent it from entering the water stream?There are thousands of ways in which plastic can end up in the water, but there is a very simple solution to the whole problem - reduce, reuse and recycle. Though Captain Planet might repeat that many times, the recycle ratio is a measly 20%. As long as that does not improve, there is no clear solution to this, the ocean is changing. I will not say dying - it is changing the ecology of the ocean. Old ones which are not able to adapt to the plastic are dying, new ones which thrive on the floating garbage are thriving. Ultimately, humans are harmed either way - the interactions are complex and even after years of research, the results are still uncertain.So reuse, reduce and recycle. The basic steps are sometimes the most important ones.  Embed Quote"
